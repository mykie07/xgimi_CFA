"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Very nice Product,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019",5.0,"Quick summary- this device provides high quality image in 1080p resolution with decent speakers and really works quite well. My friend has a Nebula Capsule Max, but I think my pictures look brighter and clearer :) The device looks premium and easy to carry around. I mainly use it to watch movies, and so far I'm very happy with it.However, there are some issues- it is not netflix certified. The customer service side suggested several ways to watch it, including Roku. I am able to sideload Netflix now, though it would be great to have the official Netflix support.- I'm thinking of buying a tripod to tilt the projection lower since my countertop for the projector is too high.Overall, it's still a great product for me. I'll update after using it for a few more days."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",WOW... AMAZING projector for its size ü•∞,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2021",5.0,"I currently have Towond 6500LUX projector and while it's pretty good projector for its price, I just couldn't resist getting this Xgimi Mogo Pro projector when I saw it at my friend's house so I decided to treat myself and my family and got this for Christmas!I was immediately attracted to this projector when I saw it in action for 2 simple reasons: 1) built-in Harman/Kardon speaker and 2)it virtually has no fan sound!While it's not fair to compare this projector to my previous Towond projector since it would be like comparing a Lexus to a Toyota but one thing that really bothered me with Towond projector was the sound of the fan spinning.  Even with the volume turned up high, I was able to hear the loud fan spinning sound when there was no dialog or music in the movie and this got annoying very quickly.  This Xigmi Mogo Pro projector has virtually no fan sound even when I'm sitting right next to it!  On top of that, the Harman/Kardon speaker is just the icing on the cake... It's such as amazing projector packed into small, portable size.WHAT I LIKE:[+] Truly a mini, portable projector unlike other ""mini"" projectors that they claim.[+] Harman/Kardon speaker baby!  Enough said.[+] Amazing video quality.[+] Virtually no fan sound while using![+] Love the built-in rechargeable battery that allows you to play up to 2 hours unplugged.  Granted, I will probably never watch a movie unplugged but this is a nice feature in case you need to move or adjust the projector without getting interrupted.[+] Built-in Android TV with virtually unlimited apps you can download and install.[+] Awesome autofocus and keystone correction that just works by itself whenever you set up or move the projector.[+] It can play video files from USB thumb drive and I was able to watch MP4 format video.[+] Came with 3 different power plug to support different regions of the world!  I have never seen this with any other products before.[+] Very slick and easy to use remote control.[+] Did I mention that it has amazing sound quality without any fan noise? üòÅWHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] I just wish that the remote control had play and pause button that will work when playing a video file from USB thumb drive.  I had to use the pause/play button on the top of the projector.  Maybe they can update the firmware to add this feature to the remote?BOTTOM LINE:10 out of 5 stars. Highly recommend this amazing mini projector that is very portable but packs a punch!  I felt in love with this projector when I first saw it but even more when I bought it and watched my first full length movie.  I can now truly enjoy a family movie time with my kids on the big screen rather than on our 42"" TV üòÇHope my video and photos were useful... and if they were, please click on the helpful button below.

"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Not 1080p + Not bright enough + no Netflix,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2021",3.0,"I agree with a lot of reviews, it‚Äôs very portable, well built, quiet and the image is very sharp and crisp.But there are too many cons that made me return it, which surprisingly nobody said:1)They claim it‚Äôs a 1080p resolution but it doesn‚Äôt look like it. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a 720p. Pixels are big. You must be behind it and far  to don‚Äôt see them. And it‚Äôs really annoying because the pixel density is clearly poor.2)Brightness is not enough either, not even with complete darkness. And in battery mode, it goes in eco mode which lower the brightness even more. Pretty useless.3)Netflix doesn‚Äôt work, which makes the all android tv experience incomplete.It‚Äôs a shame because the projector itself is great. But watching content is frustrating after a while. Based on this, the Xgimi Mogo pro is definitely overpriced and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.I just bought an Epson 880 with the same money. And there‚Äôs no comparison. The epson simply destroyed  that little thing in all department. Portability excluded of course."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor","Good projector: Portable, good resolution, and good sound!","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2020",5.0,"XGIMI MoGo pro is a portable projector with a better resolution (1920X1080) than many other projectors on the market within its price range.This is a projector to be used in small to medium sized rooms, and ideal to watch movies with your family. It is capable to project a  ‚Äú100‚Äùinch image on a ‚Äúregular‚Äù wall,  and still capture a good image resolution. The 300 ANSI lumens (how much light you are getting from a bulb/brightness) is surprisingly sufficient to enjoy a good movie.Its portability is definitely is one of its best features. The luxury of having a big screen on the go is something to appreciate.The battery works and lasts a fair amount of time without being charged. What does a fair amount mean to me? I can watch a 2 hour movie and a little bit more without shutting off. Of course, the battery could last longer, but for the price it serves more than its purpose.The sound is good for a small to medium size room. I watched movies with5 family members, and we did not have problems with the sound. Its size allows you to keep it close making you forget that it contains a small speaker.If the sound is not sufficient for you, it has bluetooth capability. You can connect a sound bar via bluetooth or even connect your wireless headphones to experience a sound that will fulfill your needs.Like almost all technology on the market it has its cons. The Netflix app does not work natively yet in their Android system, and the Hulu app does not play correctly experiencing some small delays. However, there are instructions to play the Netflix via Kodi ( I have not used this method), or you can connect your fire stick, via HDMI. Then you will be able to experience Netflix, Hulu, Prime and all apps that the Amazon fire stick offers.Another option, you can use its internal chrome cast to stream movies from Amazon Prime, Hulu, and YouTubeTv from your cell phone, but with this option you won‚Äôt be able to stream Netflix.It does not bother me to have a ‚Äúwork around‚Äù to watch Netflix, but I expect Xgimi to resolve this issue in the near future. The sound and battery could be better too. But for now, it really serves the purpose of my purchase: Portability, good resolution, good sound, good price. I am impressed with its capabilities."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Fantastic projector!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2020",5.0,"I have tried 3 didferent projectors before I got this one.  All of them were of bigger size and around $245.  The Wimius was the brand to beat.  This one was just as good, though more expensive.  The extra money was worth it.  The updated software is nice.  The sound is very good.  If you are in a pinch and don‚Äôt have a sound bar, the speaker system on this device is more than enough for you to enjoy the movie.  I have the Roku sound bar, so with that one hookup I have access to all of the video apps like Prime, Disney, and Netflix along with a great surround sound bar in one.  I have to say the portability of going cordless (as this does have a rechargeable battery) was a great thing.  Being able to place it anywhere with almost zero set up time was a game changer.  The auto-focus was so nice to have and it takes maybe 3 seconds to dial in and get it perfect.  Set up was a breeze, there really isn‚Äôt much to it.  The picture quality matches up with other native 1080 projectors and I was amazed at that, due to its small size.  For the extra money, the portability, sound, and the ease of this projector was well worth the cost.  I attached a clip of ‚ÄúTangled‚Äù.  Just like with any video of a video, the quality does not do the actual picture and sound justice.  Color is fantastic and you are able to custom tune the color, brightness, and contrast which is not an option on a lot of projectors.  Definitely consider this one!"
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Complete entertainment system,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021",5.0,"This is not just a projector, its a complete entertainment system. There are many many pros and only a couple cons.  will share my experience with pros first. It comes extremely nicely packed and the quality of the product can be gauged at the first glance itself. Super easy, plug and play projector. I unboxed and connected the power cord. Projector starts with a little setup as it has inbuilt operating system that runs on Android. Starting with the projector screen, its auto focus and adjusts itself automatically to the best possible resolution on the projected image. This is the coolest feature of all. Never to worry on adjusting the focus when the projector is moved as it takes only a few seconds to adjust to the projection and the image is crisp and clear. The operating system setup is just like setting up a new smart phone. Step by step guide to setup the projector including wifi and connecting to google play store. The projector has inbuilt memory that allows to install apps directly to the projector. It also supports HDMI input to project from external source. The inbuilt chromecast allows to cast from any laptop or android device. It also works for iOS with an app installed on the iOS device. Coming on the the screen resolution. I have Prime Videos and I tried with 4K UHD movies on Prime. There was a huge difference in the resolution I saw from this projector. This projector made me realize what a true 4K is. The brightness is amazing, picture quality is superb and the sound from its inbuilt Harman Kardon Speakers is impeccable. I don't need any other speakers and the inbuilt speakers are more than enough for my big hall to fill in with its sound. Although I am not able to play Netflix due to some app issues from Netflix but I was able to install and run almost all other streaming apps.The most important thing to note is that its a short throw projector. I am projecting at 143"" screen and the distance is just 1.5 mtrs. Its a 3D projector and needs DLP glasses to view 3D movies. I am using my 3D TV DLP glasses to view 3D movies. It also has vertical shift, which is a great feature to any projector and helps in projecting image without tilting the projector.The only con I felt is that the vertical shift needs little more improvement. Other than this is a complete projector and no more looking for any after this.DLP technology is definitely better than LED. XGiMI is a leader in projector technology and I am super glad and excited to own one."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Great performing projector while still being small and portable,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020",4.0,"Bought this after trying out a cheaper, non portable projector with similar specs. The picture quality and brightness on this one were about the same which is great considering this one is about a quarter of the size. This projector was also able to completely fill a 120‚Äù projector screen while the other one barely filled a 100‚Äù screen from the same distance away from the screen for both.The autofocus feature works really well, and I like that their is still an easy option for manual focus using the remote. The auto keystone works well for a straight on projection, and works well enough for trying to project from weird angles.This projector works well for playing games too. I plugged my laptop into it using an HDMI cord and the latency was low enough that it was barley noticeable (although not perfect).The built in android TV OS works pretty well. It wasn‚Äôt really a huge selling point as I mostly wanted to use this plugged up to my laptop, but if you just wanna quickly set it up and run of the battery to stream a movie or YouTube videos it works well. I‚Äôve only had a few small issues with using the YouTube app, but I used the built in chrome cast feature to project YouTube videos send from my phone and that worked well. Other apps like Hulu also worked well.Only con is that the brightness isn‚Äôt so strong for it to work in a well lit room. I had it set up in an area with lots of natural light. Something‚Äôs looked ok, like watching football, but for videos with dark scenes or even navigating the dark Android TV menu when it is bright out can be a bit difficult. I‚Äôm a darkened room, it looks amazing."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Netflix is NOT supported,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020",1.0,"The description is VERY clear that Netflix is supported, however it is not.  you have to go through extensive, and complex hacks to get it to work in extra poor video quality.Netflix does not work. Period.

"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",A flagship killer. Cutest little wonder with loads of features,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021",5.0,"My initial reaction was, ""how on earth is this going to fulfill so many promising latest features"". But it has got so many features within its small little cute body that I wonder why I've been waiting for so many years in search of an economical projector that would beat all the flagships.Here are some of my observations that I've been taken in awe of.1. It's design and size. It's so little. Very strong. Metal speaker grill. Fits on the palm. So easy to carry.2. It's cordless and portable. Recharges very quickly and can run both completely wirelessly or with power cord connected.3. Crystal clear like picture quality. Nothing less than a real LED TV kind. Very clear and crisp video and continuous projection. We may even get confused to television from a distance unless we notice it that it's actually a projected image on the wall. Very bright colors and light.4. Automatic focus in keystone correction. That's something that definitely takes a lot of mental away. Depending on the distance between the projector and the wall or screen it automatically adjust the focus and keystone. We don't have to do anything other than just holding the projector study for like 15 seconds. Coolest feature of all.5. It's Android TV built in. Which means it is smart straight away. We don't have to search for any smart devices too connect to to watch our favorite content.6. It has Google Chromecast built-in. So we can wirelessly mirror the content from our favorite devices also.7. Google Assistant built in. That makes it easy for us to search using voice commands. There is a shortcut key for Google Assistant on the remote controller as well.8. Automatic configuration. Once I enabled the Bluetooth and paired it via Google Assistant, as per their instructions, I was able to connect it to Wi-Fi and then include that into my Google Home devices. It's set up the Google Assistant automatically.9. Audio quality is impeccable as it has Harman kardon speakers built in. I don't question its quality because I love this brand and my car also has the same speakers. So I can imagine what it's like to have a portable Harman kardon speaker cum projector which is cordless in the pocket.10. Many built-in apps and we can add more apps via Google play store. We can stream content from any offer streaming platforms or devices connected via USB port or HDMI port.It is a simply amazing projector that I have ever seen which comes under well within the budget compared to any premium wired projectors. In my opinion it's surely a flagship killer.There is one more thing that they could have added. A storage and carry bag. This kind of premium quality device needs protection during travel. They could have added that small piece making it a complete package."

"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Great performing projector while still being small and portable,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020",4.0,"Bought this after trying out a cheaper, non portable projector with similar specs. The picture quality and brightness on this one were about the same which is great considering this one is about a quarter of the size. This projector was also able to completely fill a 120‚Äù projector screen while the other one barely filled a 100‚Äù screen from the same distance away from the screen for both.The autofocus feature works really well, and I like that their is still an easy option for manual focus using the remote. The auto keystone works well for a straight on projection, and works well enough for trying to project from weird angles.This projector works well for playing games too. I plugged my laptop into it using an HDMI cord and the latency was low enough that it was barley noticeable (although not perfect).The built in android TV OS works pretty well. It wasn‚Äôt really a huge selling point as I mostly wanted to use this plugged up to my laptop, but if you just wanna quickly set it up and run of the battery to stream a movie or YouTube videos it works well. I‚Äôve only had a few small issues with using the YouTube app, but I used the built in chrome cast feature to project YouTube videos send from my phone and that worked well. Other apps like Hulu also worked well.Only con is that the brightness isn‚Äôt so strong for it to work in a well lit room. I had it set up in an area with lots of natural light. Something‚Äôs looked ok, like watching football, but for videos with dark scenes or even navigating the dark Android TV menu when it is bright out can be a bit difficult. I‚Äôm a darkened room, it looks amazing."

"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",A flagship killer. Cutest little wonder with loads of features,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021",5.0,"My initial reaction was, ""how on earth is this going to fulfill so many promising latest features"". But it has got so many features within its small little cute body that I wonder why I've been waiting for so many years in search of an economical projector that would beat all the flagships.Here are some of my observations that I've been taken in awe of.1. It's design and size. It's so little. Very strong. Metal speaker grill. Fits on the palm. So easy to carry.2. It's cordless and portable. Recharges very quickly and can run both completely wirelessly or with power cord connected.3. Crystal clear like picture quality. Nothing less than a real LED TV kind. Very clear and crisp video and continuous projection. We may even get confused to television from a distance unless we notice it that it's actually a projected image on the wall. Very bright colors and light.4. Automatic focus in keystone correction. That's something that definitely takes a lot of mental away. Depending on the distance between the projector and the wall or screen it automatically adjust the focus and keystone. We don't have to do anything other than just holding the projector study for like 15 seconds. Coolest feature of all.5. It's Android TV built in. Which means it is smart straight away. We don't have to search for any smart devices too connect to to watch our favorite content.6. It has Google Chromecast built-in. So we can wirelessly mirror the content from our favorite devices also.7. Google Assistant built in. That makes it easy for us to search using voice commands. There is a shortcut key for Google Assistant on the remote controller as well.8. Automatic configuration. Once I enabled the Bluetooth and paired it via Google Assistant, as per their instructions, I was able to connect it to Wi-Fi and then include that into my Google Home devices. It's set up the Google Assistant automatically.9. Audio quality is impeccable as it has Harman kardon speakers built in. I don't question its quality because I love this brand and my car also has the same speakers. So I can imagine what it's like to have a portable Harman kardon speaker cum projector which is cordless in the pocket.10. Many built-in apps and we can add more apps via Google play store. We can stream content from any offer streaming platforms or devices connected via USB port or HDMI port.It is a simply amazing projector that I have ever seen which comes under well within the budget compared to any premium wired projectors. In my opinion it's surely a flagship killer.There is one more thing that they could have added. A storage and carry bag. This kind of premium quality device needs protection during travel. They could have added that small piece making it a complete package."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Good quality,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2021",5.0,"Absolutely love this projector and recommend.Prior to this purchase, I tried 2 cheaper projectors both running on Android as well and they were painfully slow. This projector is super fast with no lag even with switching between apps.Picture:feels like ultra HD 4k quality. Definitely clearer than my 70inch Samsung 2018 model. I've used this projector close where screen size is around 12 inches and as far as making it up to 14ft and both show extremely clear. For outside viewing it is best in the late afternoon or evening, earlier in the day would require some shade as it isn't bright enough to compete with bright sunlight.I've projected onto a vinyl fence, the inside of my garage door, as well as my pergola canopy, and each show super clear despite textured surfaces. Don't think you necessarily need to have a screen to enjoy.Auto adjustment is great as well. Anytime the projector is moved it auto calibrates the picture for you.Sound:Harmon kardon speakers are great. Indoors it's pretty loud but if you have a few people over you may want to connect an additional speaker. Outside it's not bad wish it could be slightly louder but definitely able to enjoy in a normal suburban neighborhood.After thoughts :I don't use the remote it came with being I plug in my Bluetooth keyboard which works perfect with it. The overall design is good, I've mostly used on table tops as I do move it around so I wish it had the ability to tilt rather than having to prop something under it to get a little angle to it. Simple to use and light weight design. I used Netflix, hbo max, YouTube, with no issues."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor","Instant movie room, all you need is a wall!","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020",5.0,"We have a super nice movie where my husband and I love to watch movies, but the problem we were having is our kids were constantly invading it. It would result in them watching a cartoon and our movie room while we watched our movie on a regular TV. We decided to invest in this gadget to create their own space for movie viewing. We did it for them, but also for us. We used the space where they already were using to lounging and playing video games, surrounded by their things and their toys. So since they already had a comfortable seat and their things, all they needed was a blank wall.Set up was easy. We are Apple users and we were concerned at first that we weren‚Äôt going to be able to use it the way we wanted, but all we needed was an adapter that plugged into an iPad and connected to HDMI. This is something we actually already had.We were impressed instantly with the quality of the sound and image. The image quality is crisp and adjusts automatically depending on your space. We have the projector sitting about 12 feet from the wall, not sure how much closer or further we can move it forward to adjust this perfectly. It has customizable settings for brightness, and it even allows 3-D. We didn‚Äôt realize that so that was a nice surprise! The quality of the sound was also very impressive. I‚Äôm not going to suggest that it is as good as my state of the art movie room, but to be in a standalone small unit like this it‚Äôs pretty freaking amazing. My kids were certainly pleased and I would be to given the price point if this is all we had.So if you were looking for an instant movie room, this is what this is. You don‚Äôt need a screen, just the wall, a Phone, possibly an adapter, and a streaming account and you are in business.If you like to travel, it does come with plug-ins that are compatible with two foreign countries, I didn‚Äôt look at them in detail so I can‚Äôt tell you where, but it‚Äôs so portable that might be something that could be a benefit."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Exceeded my expectations,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020",5.0,"This is truly an amazing projector.  It is a very handy all in one device. We have a basement home theater with an old 720p Panasonic and while I still consider the picture quality to be good for its resolution, it is a large machine and fixed in position because it needs to be wired for everything. I have been wanting to both upgrade our resolution and get something portable that can function as more of a stand alone device. This projector has met and exceeded my expectations. It is the first projector I have tried that outperforms my my aging one.The picture quality is incredible in its brightness, high contrast ratio and resolution. That was surprising to me for such a compact device. The picture quality through the apps or connected device is crisp and bright. It is a great native 1080p projector and even supports 4K ultra HD. It is best in a dark room but still bright easy to see in low lighting with connected power. When I cast my android device through the google home app, the picture is slightly lower resolution but still good. The convenience of being able to cast from a phone, or other connected device outweighs any downgrade in resolution for me. To get the higher resolution, one can easily connect a portable device, like a fire TV stick and keep that portability and clarity.The built in Harmon Kardon speaker has great sound quality, very loud and full sound. I do not find that I need additional speakers to be able to enjoy a movie. For when I do want to use surround sound, I do love the convenience of having Bluetooth connectivity, which allows me to use a Bluetooth speaker system and not have wires all over the place. Bluetooth pairing was straightforward and quick for me to set up. There is also an auxiliary connection for sound.It really is a great stand-alone device, especially with its built in battery that allows it to be used without connected power. I should note that the picture is slightly less bright on battery power to conserve battery, but not much. The battery life is sufficient for me to be able to enjoy a movie, which will be handy for when we use it outside. I absolutely love the quick autofocus and vertical keystone correction. It ensures that my projected image is crisp and clear at all times. Horizontal keystone correction is done manually, but easy to do if it is needed. I tend to centrally locate the projector on a table in front on me and find the horizontal correction unnecessary. Since the cooling fan is so quiet while it is running, there is no distraction from fan noise, having the projector close by.I am finding it to be very user-friendly with a variety of ways to use it. Being a smart projector it has several apps like Google Play, Disney, etc. available for direct streaming. Basically anything you can view on a chrome cast device, you can access with this projector. Netflix, Prime and Hulu are not yet directly available, however, these can be accessed easily through either screen casting or with a connected HDMI device like a fire TV stick. They are working on the licensing to make those extensions available. The projector is also able to play from portable hard drives if you have downloaded content.Overall, I am thrilled with this projector. The performance is incredible and it has exceeded my expectations."

I actually compared three highly rated portable projectors hands-on before finalizing on this champ. I ordered XGimi Mogo Pro, Nebula Capsule 2 and Nebula Solar Portable. Finally kept XGimi Mogo Pro. Here are my ratings on each.XGimi Mogo Pro -Picture quality - 5/5Sound- 4/5Portability-5/5Connections - 4/5 (@ this price USB-C would have been preferred over 19V DC charger)Fan Noise- 4/5Auto focus - 5/5Operating system - 3.5/5 (Android TV sometimes goes in trance mode and has no clue what it is doing. I have hooked latest Google TV dongle, and it works smoothly.)Build Quality - 4/5 (3.5 mm audio jack seems to be messed up on the hardware I received. Spits out 3.5 mm extension cable as port is not flushed properly with the body. Lets see if XGimi guys resolve the issue after reading this review)Nebula Capsule II -Picture quality - 3/5 (Obviously! Nebula II is only 720P, Mogo Pro and Solar are 1080P)Sound- 10/5 (Yes! nothing comes close to Capsule II in sound. Hands down it has the best sound.)Portability-6/5 (Yes! Its very solid and very portable)Connections - 5/5 (USB-C for charging, that is great!)Fan Noise- 3/5Auto focus - 4/5Operating system - 3/5 (I found OS is very sluggish)Build Quality - 5/5Nebula Solar Portable -Picture quality - 5/5Sound- 3/5 (Sound seems tiny compared to size of projector)Portability-3/5Connections - 5/5Fan Noise- 3/5Auto focus - 5/5Operating system - 3/5 (I found OS is very sluggish)Build Quality - 5/5Verdict: Xgimi Mogo Pro is winner. For its size and 1080P resolution it is no brainer againts Nebula line up. If Nebula Capsule II was 1080P, I would keep Capsule II over XGimi Mogo Pro. Nebula Solar Portable is bulky compared to other two so that is out.Other toughts: USB-C is missing. Addition of case would have been great!"
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Perfect if you don't use Netflix,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020",4.0,"This really isn't the fault of XGIMI, but hardware-wise, this is almost perfect. It's quiet, the brightness is adjustable by color, the remote is great. The fan is audible with the maximum brightness set, but if you have any sound going, you won't really notice it unless it's right next to you. I noticed a little stuttering with 4K youtube, but I'm not sure why it's running at 4K to begin with. The native resolution is 1080P.The biggest problem is that I can't play Netflix on this machine. I've looked far and wide, and the reason is because Netflix blocks it, you can sideload the Android (phone) app, but the Android TV app doesn't work. I can't even cast Netflix to it! So if you don't use Netflix, this machine is perfect, Prime Video, Disney+, YouTube, anything else you use should work - just not Netflix."

Very weak and tinny sounding.  I have a JBL Charge 3 I Bluetooth with so it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. So many cheap Bluetooth speakers on the market with great sound, plus you can position the speakers near the screen. I would almost prefer this to not come with speakers and all and come in a smaller form factor. Picture quality is... incredible. My brother has the LG portable projector and I‚Äôd say the image on this is crisper. Haven‚Äôt used it outdoors but in a dark room the 300 ANSI lumens are enough. When only used for a 50-70 inch picture it almost appears 4K."

Its most important advantage is the image resolution and compact body.  The sound is clear, but not very low frequencies (not very suitable for listening to music).  It seems to me that the manufacturer has not fully disclosed the capabilities of the device.  What I would do: add the ability to voice control the device, turn the projector on and off (similar to the work of smart speakers with a built-in voice assistant).  It is imperative to make separate use of the device as a smart speaker and as a projector.  Therefore, now you have to turn on the device and control it from the remote control, and there is no way to just listen to music without turning on the projector (the projector is always turned on when the device is turned on).  In total, I would have implemented: 1) added a subwoofer for more pronounced low frequencies 2) added a voice assistant and separate use of device functions (speaker, projector);  3) (optional) display with the ability to display time, emotions, etc.  (but not just an LCD, but with separate large ""pixels"" throughout the body (its part)."

In my first impression Xgimi Mogo Pro is a very good portable projector for its prise to watch movies and entertain your friends and families during those movie nights inside your home or outside in a backyard! Very light weight with amazing picture quality and built in android tv to access great variety  of entertainment on your finger tips. I personally think Mogo pro has a little better, crisp picture quality than Nebula Capsule II with very good auto focus lenses, but Capsule II beats Mogo Pro on the audio performance with comparatively better in built bass. I decided to go with Mogo considering how much my kids like and enjoy it..Reason for 1 less star - no native Netflix app & sound system"

I am shocked at the quality and picture of this mini projector.  The setup is simple when you first plug it in the setup wizard walks you through the setup.  It is an Android TV and has all of the major apps ready to go.  The projector finds the corners of the screen and adjusts the size accordingly.  The projector also auto focuses itself.  The picture is very bright, clear and crisp.  I have a large ceiling mounted projector that was about 4 times the price from a major brand and we all agree that this mini projector has a better picture.  The projector is small and compact and is easy to transport and store . The sound is ok it does get very loud but it is nothing special.  Hook a sound at to it and you have an awesome theater.

The first one is the CC Dark Knight which we are very satisfied with what it can offer. MoGo is such a wonderful upgrade and improvement in picture which supports video format up to 4K Ultra HD. This tiny and elegant portable projector has certainly transformed our home entertainment to the next level as we have been using it in our living room, so basically we watch everything on it, movies, TV series, Youtube videos and etc. It has been about two weeks since we received MoGo and it has not yet disappointed us. The set up with pairing both the remote control and our Google account were instant. We were surprised to see a sharp and crisp image from such a compact projector. Another excitement is the 210 ANSI Lumen power delivering cinematic images with fantastic clarity. The next thing we wanna try out is to connect via Bluetooth with our B&O speaker so that we could have movie night with friends and family during the xmas holiday.

Even if you have some light coming in from the window, you can still see the image well.  With the projector on my tripod and about 8ft away the screen size is nice and large.  Sound of the speakers is nice and loud but hardly no bass, I have my Boss desktop speakers pulled into the the headphone jack and with that I have my own home theater.  Contrast is on the gray side.

The only thing I could get to wirelessly screen mirror was YouTube. (A google app)An HDMI to lightning adapter works flawlessly from my phone or iPad. Which is what I planned on doing anyway.Great product. Highly recommend"

I got it to watch movies with the family in the yard on the weekends given the summer and covid.  Picture is great and built in Android TV with Google Assistant work great.  The UI for me is instantly familiar and I was up and running quickly.  I connected my UE Blueooth speaker with no issues and set it right behind our seating for that surround sound feeling.  Prime, HBO Max and Disney Plus work natively with no problem.I had to plug in a chromecast for Netflix movies which was a bit of a bummer but the chromecast allowed for me to use my Xfinity mobile tv app which ended up being a bonus for Shark Week!I reached out to Xgimi support and Ari responded right away around my questions when Netflix will be supported. sounds like it's more of a licensing support issue and not a technical issues.  I am hopeful this will be resolved soon but the chromecast was an easy fix for me and carries the bonus of being able to use your local cable provider's mobile live tv app."

We are using it in our bedroom where we do not have a tv installed. Quality and resolution of projected images are outstanding at a projection distance of 3.5 meters in a dark room. It‚Äôs like to be at the cinema. We enjoy films and tv shows using some enterteinment apps like Amazon prime video. My wife often travel for work, and she is taking mogo pro with her to project her presentations connecting it through a hdmi cable to her notebook. She is very satisfied, it‚Äôs very portabile! Moreover, we connected mogo pro to our iphone through a hdmi adaptor, to project our pictures and home made videos: so easy to use - the room should be a bit dark to enjoy the quality of the pictures. The battery duration is reasonnable: sometimes we had to connect mogo pro to the power supply to complete watching the movie. Finally, mogo pro has bluetooth: perfect to connect AirPods and watch movies without waking up our child! Definitely suggested!"

The manual keystone controls did the trick and gets exactly what I want! Android TV is smooth and familiar since I also have a NVIDIA Shield. Remote is much better than average and wireless is a big plus. Then only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is Netflix not yet certified to work. If that happens, will gladly update to 5 stars. I don't think there is a better mini projector with built in android TV (and I looked at the Nebula units...)"

"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",Should've been a Home run but it was far from it.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020",2.0,"Here are my Pros: Overall you cannot get all these features in any other projector at this price point. Picture quality is fantastic you can definitely see that it is 1080p. I love the autofocus and the vertical and horizontal keystone as I project from the side onto the wall.All that being said here are my Cons: The ""high quality Harmon Kardon"" do not offer very much volume, the sound is flat and tingy when it tries to get to higher volumes. I've had sound drop issues as well.The picture has been great when it works. I have had multiple instances where the entire image pixelates and the image drops out. On high brightness the picture is extremely Green in color. Due to the lumens on this protector it struggles with dim scenes in movies.I hooked up my Roku stick with this projector and to my surprise there is no sound out. The only reason I hooked up my Roku was for the lack of support of Netflix which can still be worked around through other apps on Android TV that is built into the MOGO Pro.In my opinion at this price point the issues with sound and picture should be unacceptable. I'll be returning this and continuing my search for a projector with similar features.Update: I've messaged Xgimi and their techs have solved the problem with the sound drop out and the problem of no sound from my Roku Express. This is good except that Bluetooth is garbled when connected to a Bluetooth speaker or when using Bluetooth with the HDMI port. There are MANY remaining issues with this projector. The screen pixelation that occurs on YouTube, Xgimi acknowledged this was a problem and said it will be in a patch in the future. I didn't get a timeline for that so in the meantime I'll just use the Roku for YouTube. I was going to keep this but I kept running into more software snags Xgimi said they were aware and that it would be in an upcoming update but couldn't give me an estimated timeline for when I should expect it to be fixed. In addition there are issues with Hulu playback where the image is frozen but there is still sound playing. My question is, why do they advertise that Hulu, YouTube and Netflix works when they clearly don't. Don't advertise if the experience isn't available.Get an Epson 2100 or 2150. It's no portable but I got mine refurbished from Amazon for less than the Xgimi MOGO Pro. There quality is leaps and bounds above Xgimi. I plug in my Roku express and I'm blown away by the projector colors and brightness. This is bulkier and it's not smart but for the picture that it puts out 1000% better than the MOGO Pro. Also Google is going to be releasing its own android TV dongle later this year. Then my Epson 2100 will be essentially the same as Xgimi except better because it will support every app in the play store."

I bought it directly from their official site during their promotion. It is perfect for kids to watch it in the room. I think it is bright enough for in the evening even with a bit light on.Pros:1. The fan is pretty quiet.2. The sound quality is good.3. Android TV and chromecast system is good. You can actually play youtube, disney+, Amazon Prime. (But not netflix)4. Voice control5. It comes with three kinda plugs for different countries. And it works with 110-240v6. The size is pretty compact. Like a half galleon milk and 2/3 height.Cons:1. It has auto focus. But it doesn't work perfectly every time.2. Smart keystone adjustment doesn't seem to work either. I can adjust it manually.3. no Netflix. (You can't run it directly with the official version)4. You can't move the image up or down. You can physically adjust the machine.5. You can't control it from your phone app. It does come with a remote.Overall I like it when it is at discount price that is cheaper than Nebula Apollo.I uploaded two photo I took when I projected it to my wall. One with light on and one with light off. (light is on top which is very close to the part of wall I projected) There is a small light in a far corner in both cases."

I opted for the non-pro version to save a few bucks and it'll only be for outdoor movie night occasional use. Although the Mogo is only 540P, it's image quality is very good. Movies and video look great, but text is a little jagged, (not blurry), and I imagine you would see improvements in the true HD Pro version. Auto keystone and auto focus works perfectly, a sec or 2 and it self adjusts. The remote control is fluid, no lags, as well as Android TV 9. Truly is a complete package. No more lugging a large projector outdoors, with bluetooth dongle, amazon firestick plugged in, extension cords, etc. I've downloaded all our movie/tv apps, like netflix, disney, prime video, charge it up and we're ready to go. Definitely a keeper!"

Enter the Mogo Pro.  The picture quality is spot-on.  Some HD TVs may have better picture quality, but for the normal viewer, this is spectacular.  Sound quality is great, as the Harmon-Kardon heritage would suggest.  Software updates are simple, and it connects quite easily to YouTube, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Google Play, and many more.  Super easy.  It also has plugs for connecting via HDMI to a laptop, but this isn't necessary if you're utilizing a streaming service.  The Mogo Pro also contains a standard mounting system, like you'd find on any high end camera, action camera, or GoPro.  This means that if you already have a nice tripod you like, you can use this for movie nights!  Couldn't be more stoke to have this device and use it for many years :)"

It is bright, sharp, has Android TV, is compact & portable, and just fun to use. I have used this for a couple of weeks, and have some thoughts. I was able to get a 10% coupon by signing up for XGIMI's mailing list, and for $500, this is a great buy.The Pros:-The MoGo Pro is very small and portable without compromising on image quality. The battery life is also decent.-The automatic focus is really nice to have and saves me time and sanity. You can also manually focus the projector with a switch on the bottom of the remote.-The projected image looks great, is pretty bright, and can go up to around 110"" before the brightness starts to drop off. (This is with the power cable connected)-It has a tripod mount on the bottom, which allows me to throw this on either a Mini Tripod (I used the Manfrotto Pixi) or a full-size tripod. This was almost a necessity for me.-While I prefer Roku, the Android TV interface has pretty much everything that you will need. I really enjoyed using the Plex app with my own content.-The remote is light, easy to use, and feels good in the hand.-It has an audio out jack if you want to hook it up to a home theater system, an external speaker, or some headphones with no noticeable lag.-The projector has Bluetooth, and I was able to connect my Bluetooth headphones, a Bluetooth speaker, and even a Bluetooth keyboard.-I was able to load music and videos on a thumb drive, plug it into the USB port, and play it on the projector.-The projector came in a double-layered package with Silica Gel and high-quality foam. It should make it to you in one piece.The ""Okays"":-The sound quality and volume of the built-in speaker is pretty good, but if there will be much background noise, or the sound needs to travel a long distance, I would recommend connecting an external speaker.-It didn't include batteries for the remote, so make sure that you have a couple of AAA's lying around...-On this projector, a 100"" image is produced from 8-9 feet away.The Cons:-The battery life of the projector could be better. I was able to watch a movie on it just fine, but it didn't have much extra.-The screen brightness drops a bit when on battery power. If you are projecting less than a 100"" screen, you will be fine, but if you plan to go bigger than 90"", you may want to use the power cord.When I was researching projectors, I had some findings that I wanted to share with you. These are not all specific to the MoGo Pro.-First of all, projector brightness marketing is a lie. The XGIMI MoGo Pro advertises 300 ANSI Lumens of brightness. I have a friend who got a projector that claimed 5500 Lumens of brightness. While you would think that my friends' projector would be 18 times brighter than mine, it's really not. And from what I have read, this is not an isolated case. Don't bother with the manufacturers' brightness numbers. If you want to see how bright a projector is, read the reviews.-Second, unless you plan on projecting on the side of your light-colored house, any projection size over 150"" is basically pointless. I understand that a 300"" screen sounds cool, but trust me, 98% of you don't need your projection to be that big, and will never use it that big. I'm not saying to not buy a projector that can go that big. I am saying to not buy a projector JUST because it can go that big.-Third, don't forget that screen size is measured diagonally. If you need to convert height & width to diagonal (or vice-versa), I would recommend finding an online calculator that can do that.-Fourth, don't forget the input. For the MoGo Pro, it has Android TV built-in, which will cover most of your needs, including YouTube, and all of the major streaming services that I know of. However, other projectors may not have Android TV, and before you buy, make sure that you also know how you will get a video to it. The worst thing is to get your shiny new projector and realize that you forgot to buy an HDMI Cable.-Fifth, some projectors may be able to go to big sizes, but the projector will have to be so far away from the screen that it is impossible indoors. Make sure the projector you choose can go to the screen size you want, at a distance that will work with your living space.-Sixth, if you have a light-colored wall, you probably don't need a screen, If you are considering a screen, hold a white sheet of paper up to the wall and compare how the projector on the paper looks to how the wall looks. That will give you a general idea of how much a screen will help."

Sound quality is superb and fills the room. Ever since I bought this projector, we use TV less because this projector is small enough to be portable and we take it everywhere in the house to watch movies and series. We even carry it when we travel. Moreover, it has all the great features that include auto focus, keystone correction, screen mirroring content from mobiles phones using air screen and much more. Also you can play movies from Netflix and amazon prime videos. Brightness is very good in a dark room. Overall this‚Äôs a great product for the price we pay and we really enjoy watching movies on this projector. You can see the attached pictures, the projector is placed 10 ft from the wall and projected on to white wall in a dark room"

XGIMI customer service told me they are working on a solution but how long is a customer suppose to wait? Netflix is a must and if it won't work, what's the point of having a portable WiFi enabled projector. There were other minor issues... it wouldn't connect to my WiFi immediately and it took almost an hour of chatting with customer service to get the WiFi issue resolved. An electronic device at this price point should just work straight out of the box! So, unfortunately I'll have to return it. :(Good news:Brightness - Awesome! Bright enough that you don't need a screen and can use a wall or other white painted surface. We used the garage door as our backdrop. Blacks get somewhat washed out and it can be difficult to see details when you're watching a dark movie scene (e.g., Ironman, the Winter Soldier - the opening scene when Ironman conducts a raid on the hijacked ship) but I'm sure brightness would improve using a better screen.Sound - Very good! The Harman / Kardon speakers are pretty loud but the bass is a little weak. Perfect if it's just a few of you surrounding the projector.Bluetooth - Works like a champ! Connects to external speakers for a better sound experience.Apps - Good. I didn't try Amazon, but it works with Disney+, YouTube, etc. Like a said at the top, the big NEGATIVE is that this device doesn't work with Netflix. No matter what you try, you will get an error message stating ""this device is not compatible with the Netflix app.""WiFi - Works. Seemed a bit glitchy at first but was able to add new access points without issue after initial setup.That's it! Good device if you don't need Netflix."
"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor","Excellent picture, but has some annoying flaws.","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2020",3.0,"I got this projector yesterday and I was really excited to use it, but that quickly turned to frustration. There are two main issues with the software1. You can't install Netflix directly from the Google Play Store, it is incompatible with this device. It sounds like the issue is a licensing problem with Netflix that XGIMI are trying to resolve, so maybe we'll get a fix for this in a future update. So, users are asked to download a third party app that installs a different build of the apk that works with the device. Doing this got me into Netflix, but the cursor would randomly stop responding when trying to scroll through the menus, but I could still select the item I was on. So, with that in mind, we decided to try watching Hulu. Which brings us to2. Hulu video freezes up every 10 seconds or so. The audio will continue to play, but the video will freeze for a few seconds, then it would catch up to the audio again, play normally for a few seconds, and then the video would freeze and repeat this process. Looking through some of the other comments I see this is a common problem for a few other users as well.SO, with those two options out of the picture, we tried using VLC Media Player to stream a movie I have on a network drive and this worked perfectly. The picture quality looks incredible, especially compared to the RIF6 Cube I had been using up until this point. The Harmon Kardon speaker was loud enough that we didn't need to use an external speaker, though I don't think it would hold up in a larger group setting. The remote is nice and easy to use, and it uses bluetooth so you don't have to actually point it at the projector for it to work.TL:DR - The hardware of the projector is solid and the picture quality is outstanding, but the software leaves a lot to be desired. Netflix and Hulu will give you issues if playing directly on the device, but it seems like all my problems will be remedied by simply plugging in a Chromecast and streaming through that instead."

"Xgimi Mogo Pro, Mini Portable Projector Smart, True 1080P Full HD, 300 ANSI Lumen, Android TV 9.0, Harman/Kardon Speakers, 30,000 Hours Lamp Life Android TV Portable Projector Outdoor and Indoor",I feel misled,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020",2.0,"First of all, if you don't have internet/wifi, DON'T buy this just thinking it'll be a projector. It NEEDS wifi and a google account before it'll even let you go to the projector mode. It seems to be 50/50 if it'll accept your router even if you do have wifi. Most Android TVs have a 'Skip' button on the wifi and google account setups, not so here. I couldn't tell you what the reasoning is behind that. The other thing that isn't mentioned in the product description that I feel is super important is that 3D DOES NOT WORK in four-corner keystone mode. This is a common thing with lower cost projectors and honestly I didn't think I had to ask here because this is not a low cost projector and not some knockoff company selling them, but apparently I really should have. I didn't really test anything else, after being so annoyed by the wifi not connecting at my house and not even being able to test it (And having to drag the thing to a friend's house on the random chance it might like his router, which for some reason it did) only to IMMEDIATELY find out that the most important thing to me is disabled when I'm projecting in the only mode I'll ever be projecting in because it's a PORTABLE projector. It's critical to be able to project from any angle and still have access to all the features I'm paying for. Also you can't set up the keystone correction until after you log in via the internet, so prepare to be pretty annoyed using the onscreen keyboard to type in wifi info and google accounts (Especially if you end up having to do it multiple times like I did) if you don't have a straight-on surface handy to set it up with."

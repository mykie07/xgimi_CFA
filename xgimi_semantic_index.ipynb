      "I currently have Towond 6500LUX projector and while it's pretty good projector for its price, I just couldn't resist getting this Xgimi Mogo Pro projector when I saw it at my friend's house so I decided to treat myself and my family and got this for Christmas!I was immediately attracted to this projector when I saw it in action for 2 simple reasons: 1) built-in Harman/Kardon speaker and 2)it virtually has no fan sound!While it's not fair to compare this projector to my previous Towond projector since it would be like comparing a Lexus to a Toyota but one thing that really bothered me with Towond projector was the sound of the fan spinning.\n",
      "Even with the volume turned up high, I was able to hear the loud fan spinning sound when there was no dialog or music in the movie and this got annoying very quickly.\n",
      "This Xigmi Mogo Pro projector has virtually no fan sound even when I'm sitting right next to it!\n",
      "On top of that, the Harman/Kardon speaker is just the icing on the cake...\n",
      "It's such as amazing projector packed into small, portable size.WHAT I LIKE: Truly a mini, portable projector unlike other \"mini\" projectors that they claim.\n",
      "Harman/Kardon speaker baby!\n",
      "Enough said.\n",
      "Amazing video quality.\n",
      "Virtually no fan sound while using!\n",
      "Love the built-in rechargeable battery that allows you to play up to 2 hours unplugged.\n",
      "Granted, I will probably never watch a movie unplugged but this is a nice feature in case you need to move or adjust the projector without getting interrupted.\n",
      "Built-in Android TV with virtually unlimited apps you can download and install.\n",
      "Awesome autofocus and keystone correction that just works by itself whenever you set up or move the projector.\n",
      "It can play video files from USB thumb drive and I was able to watch MP4 format video.\n",
      "Came with 3 different power plug to support different regions of the world!\n",
      "I have never seen this with any other products before.\n",
      "Very slick and easy to use remote control.\n",
      "Did I mention that it has amazing sound quality without any fan noise?\n",

      "I had to use the pause/play button on the top of the projector.\n",
      "Maybe they can update the firmware to add this feature to the remote?BOTTOM LINE:10 out of 5 stars.\n",

      "I agree with a lot of reviews, it‚Äôs very portable, well built, quiet and the image is very sharp and crisp.But there are too many cons that made me return it, which surprisingly nobody said:1)They claim it‚Äôs a 1080p resolution but it doesn‚Äôt look like it.\n",
      "I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a 720p.\n",
      "Pixels are big.\n",

      "And it‚Äôs really annoying because the pixel density is clearly poor.2)Brightness is not enough either, not even with complete darkness.\n",
      "And in battery mode, it goes in eco mode which lower the brightness even more.\n",
      "Pretty useless.3)Netflix doesn‚Äôt work, which makes the all android tv experience incomplete.It‚Äôs a shame because the projector itself is great.\n",
      "But watching content is frustrating after a while.\n",
      "Based on this, the Xgimi Mogo pro is definitely overpriced and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.I just bought an Epson 880 with the same money.\n",

      "Portability excluded of course.\n",
      "XGIMI MoGo pro is a portable projector with a better resolution (1920X1080) than many other projectors on the market within its price range.This is a projector to be used in small to medium sized rooms, and ideal to watch movies with your family.\n",

      "What does a fair amount mean to me?\n",
      "I can watch a 2 hour movie and a little bit more without shutting off.\n",
      "Of course, the battery could last longer, but for the price it serves more than its purpose.The sound is good for a small to medium size room.\n",
      "I watched movies with5 family members, and we did not have problems with the sound.\n",

      "Then you will be able to experience Netflix, Hulu, Prime and all apps that the Amazon fire stick offers.Another option, you can use its internal chrome cast to stream movies from Amazon Prime, Hulu, and YouTubeTv from your cell phone, but with this option you won‚Äôt be able to stream Netflix.It does not bother me to have a ‚Äúwork around‚Äù  to watch Netflix, but I expect Xgimi to resolve this issue in the near future.\n",
      "The sound and battery could be better too.\n",

      "I attached a clip of ‚ÄúTangled‚Äù .\n",
      "Just like with any video of a video, the quality does not do the actual picture and sound justice.\n",
      "Color is fantastic and you are able to custom tune the color, brightness, and contrast which is not an option on a lot of projectors.\n",
      "Definitely consider this one!\n",
      "This is not just a projector, its a complete entertainment system.\n",
      "There are many many pros and only a couple cons.\n",
      "will share my experience with pros first.\n",
      "It comes extremely nicely packed and the quality of the product can be gauged at the first glance itself.\n",
      "Super easy, plug and play projector.\n",
      "I unboxed and connected the power cord.\n",
      "Projector starts with a little setup as it has inbuilt operating system that runs on Android.\n",
      "Starting with the projector screen, its auto focus and adjusts itself automatically to the best possible resolution on the projected image.\n",
      "This is the coolest feature of all.\n",
      "Never to worry on adjusting the focus when the projector is moved as it takes only a few seconds to adjust to the projection and the image is crisp and clear.\n",
      "The operating system setup is just like setting up a new smart phone.\n",
      "Step by step guide to setup the projector including wifi and connecting to google play store.\n",
      "The projector has inbuilt memory that allows to install apps directly to the projector.\n",
      "It also supports HDMI input to project from external source.\n",
      "The inbuilt chromecast allows to cast from any laptop or android device.\n",
      "It also works for iOS with an app installed on the iOS device.\n",
      "Coming on the the screen resolution.\n",
      "I have Prime Videos and I tried with 4K UHD movies on Prime.\n",
      "There was a huge difference in the resolution I saw from this projector.\n",
      "This projector made me realize what a true 4K is.\n",
      "The brightness is amazing, picture quality is superb and the sound from its inbuilt Harman Kardon Speakers is impeccable.\n",
      "I don't need any other speakers and the inbuilt speakers are more than enough for my big hall to fill in with its sound.\n",
      "Although I am not able to play Netflix due to some app issues from Netflix but I was able to install and run almost all other streaming apps.The most important thing to note is that its a short throw projector.\n",
      "I am projecting at 143\" screen and the distance is just 1.5 mtrs.\n",
      "Its a 3D projector and needs DLP glasses to view 3D movies.\n",
      "I am using my 3D TV DLP glasses to view 3D movies.\n",
      "It also has vertical shift, which is a great feature to any projector and helps in projecting image without tilting the projector.The only con I felt is that the vertical shift needs little more improvement.\n",
      "Other than this is a complete projector and no more looking for any after this.DLP technology is definitely better than LED.\n",
      "XGiMI is a leader in projector technology and I am super glad and excited to own one.\n",
      "Bought this after trying out a cheaper, non portable projector with similar specs.\n",
      "The picture quality and brightness on this one were about the same which is great considering this one is about a quarter of the size.\n",
      "This projector was also able to completely fill a 120‚Äù  projector screen while the other one barely filled a 100‚Äù  screen from the same distance away from the screen for both.The autofocus feature works really well, and I like that their is still an easy option for manual focus using the remote.\n",
      "The auto keystone works well for a straight on projection, and works well enough for trying to project from weird angles.This projector works well for playing games too.\n",
      "I plugged my laptop into it using an HDMI cord and the latency was low enough that it was barley noticeable (although not perfect).The built in android TV OS works pretty well.\n",
      "It wasn‚Äôt really a huge selling point as I mostly wanted to use this plugged up to my laptop, but if you just wanna quickly set it up and run of the battery to stream a movie or YouTube videos it works well.\n",
      "I‚Äôve only had a few small issues with using the YouTube app, but I used the built in chrome cast feature to project YouTube videos send from my phone and that worked well.\n",
      "Other apps like Hulu also worked well.Only con is that the brightness isn‚Äôt so strong for it to work in a well lit room.\n",
      "I had it set up in an area with lots of natural light.\n",
      "Something‚Äôs looked ok, like watching football, but for videos with dark scenes or even navigating the dark Android TV menu when it is bright out can be a bit difficult.\n",
      "I‚Äôm a darkened room, it looks amazing.\n",
      "The description is VERY clear that Netflix is supported, however it is not.\n",
      "you have to go through extensive, and complex hacks to get it to work in extra poor video quality.Netflix does not work.\n",
      "Period.\n",
      "With no estimated date of it working.the device itself is wonderful.\n",
      "nice picture, quiet, decent speaker, but the people who wrote the advertising just lied about Netflix functionality.The device is basically useless without support for it.\n",
      "My initial reaction was, \"how on earth is this going to fulfill so many promising latest features\".\n",
      "But it has got so many features within its small little cute body that I wonder why I've been waiting for so many years in search of an economical projector that would beat all the flagships.Here are some of my observations that I've been taken in awe of.1.\n",
      "It's design and size.\n",
      "It's so little.\n",
      "Very strong.\n",
      "Metal speaker grill.\n",
      "Fits on the palm.\n",
      "So easy to carry.2.\n",
      "It's cordless and portable.\n",
      "Recharges very quickly and can run both completely wirelessly or with power cord connected.3.\n",
      "Crystal clear like picture quality.\n",
      "Nothing less than a real LED TV kind.\n",
      "Very clear and crisp video and continuous projection.\n",
      "We may even get confused to television from a distance unless we notice it that it's actually a projected image on the wall.\n",
      "Very bright colors and light.4.\n",
      "Automatic focus in keystone correction.\n",
      "That's something that definitely takes a lot of mental away.\n",
      "Depending on the distance between the projector and the wall or screen it automatically adjust the focus and keystone.\n",
      "We don't have to do anything other than just holding the projector study for like 15 seconds.\n",
      "Coolest feature of all.5.\n",
      "It's Android TV built in.\n",
      "Which means it is smart straight away.\n",
      "We don't have to search for any smart devices too connect to to watch our favorite content.6.\n",
      "It has Google Chromecast built-in.\n",
      "So we can wirelessly mirror the content from our favorite devices also.7.\n",
      "Google Assistant built in.\n",
      "That makes it easy for us to search using voice commands.\n",
      "There is a shortcut key for Google Assistant on the remote controller as well.8.\n",
      "Automatic configuration.\n",
      "Once I enabled the Bluetooth and paired it via Google Assistant, as per their instructions, I was able to connect it to Wi-Fi and then include that into my Google Home devices.\n",
      "It's set up the Google Assistant automatically.9.\n",
      "Audio quality is impeccable as it has Harman kardon speakers built in.\n",
      "I don't question its quality because I love this brand and my car also has the same speakers.\n",
      "So I can imagine what it's like to have a portable Harman kardon speaker cum projector which is cordless in the pocket.10.\n",
      "Many built-in apps and we can add more apps via Google play store.\n",
      "We can stream content from any offer streaming platforms or devices connected via USB port or HDMI port.It is a simply amazing projector that I have ever seen which comes under well within the budget compared to any premium wired projectors.\n",
      "In my opinion it's surely a flagship killer.There is one more thing that they could have added.\n",
      "A storage and carry bag.\n",
      "This kind of premium quality device needs protection during travel.\n",
      "They could have added that small piece making it a complete package.\n",
      "I tried ViewSonic M1+ , Nebula capsule max, capsule 2 projectors and finally I ended up with XGIMI Mogo pro.After I tried all these projectors, I feel XGIMI Mogo pro is best.\n",
      "Below are the pros and consPros:1) Full HD2) Dual Wifi band support3) Good sound4) Quick auto focus5) Portable6) Build in Chromecast7) Less noise8) Android TV 9.0Cons:1) No official Netflix app.\n",
      "But you can watch using XTV manager.2) No official Amazon prime app.\n",
      "But you can cast using Chromecast.I hope they will add these primary apps soon.\n",
      "Quick summary- this device provides high quality image in 1080p resolution with decent speakers and really works quite well.\n",
      "My friend has a Nebula Capsule Max, but I think my pictures look brighter and clearer :) The device looks premium and easy to carry around.\n",
      "I mainly use it to watch movies, and so far I'm very happy with it.However, there are some issues- it is not netflix certified.\n",

      "The inbuilt chromecast allows to cast from any laptop or android device.\n",
      "It also works for iOS with an app installed on the iOS device.\n",
      "Coming on the the screen resolution.\n",
      "I have Prime Videos and I tried with 4K UHD movies on Prime.\n",
      "There was a huge difference in the resolution I saw from this projector.\n",
      "This projector made me realize what a true 4K is.\n",
      "The brightness is amazing, picture quality is superb and the sound from its inbuilt Harman Kardon Speakers is impeccable.\n",
      "I don't need any other speakers and the inbuilt speakers are more than enough for my big hall to fill in with its sound.\n",
      "Although I am not able to play Netflix due to some app issues from Netflix but I was able to install and run almost all other streaming apps.The most important thing to note is that its a short throw projector.\n",
      "I am projecting at 143\" screen and the distance is just 1.5 mtrs.\n",
      "Its a 3D projector and needs DLP glasses to view 3D movies.\n",
      "I am using my 3D TV DLP glasses to view 3D movies.\n",
      "It also has vertical shift, which is a great feature to any projector and helps in projecting image without tilting the projector.The only con I felt is that the vertical shift needs little more improvement.\n",
      "Other than this is a complete projector and no more looking for any after this.DLP technology is definitely better than LED.\n",
      "XGiMI is a leader in projector technology and I am super glad and excited to own one.\n",
      "Bought this after trying out a cheaper, non portable projector with similar specs.\n",
      "The picture quality and brightness on this one were about the same which is great considering this one is about a quarter of the size.\n",
      "This projector was also able to completely fill a 120‚Äù  projector screen while the other one barely filled a 100‚Äù  screen from the same distance away from the screen for both.The autofocus feature works really well, and I like that their is still an easy option for manual focus using the remote.\n",
      "The auto keystone works well for a straight on projection, and works well enough for trying to project from weird angles.This projector works well for playing games too.\n",
      "I plugged my laptop into it using an HDMI cord and the latency was low enough that it was barley noticeable (although not perfect).The built in android TV OS works pretty well.\n",
      "It wasn‚Äôt really a huge selling point as I mostly wanted to use this plugged up to my laptop, but if you just wanna quickly set it up and run of the battery to stream a movie or YouTube videos it works well.\n",
      "I‚Äôve only had a few small issues with using the YouTube app, but I used the built in chrome cast feature to project YouTube videos send from my phone and that worked well.\n",
      "Other apps like Hulu also worked well.Only con is that the brightness isn‚Äôt so strong for it to work in a well lit room.\n",
      "I had it set up in an area with lots of natural light.\n",
      "Something‚Äôs looked ok, like watching football, but for videos with dark scenes or even navigating the dark Android TV menu when it is bright out can be a bit difficult.\n",
      "I‚Äôm a darkened room, it looks amazing.\n",
      "The description is VERY clear that Netflix is supported, however it is not.\n",
      "you have to go through extensive, and complex hacks to get it to work in extra poor video quality.Netflix does not work.\n",
      "Period.\n",
      "With no estimated date of it working.the device itself is wonderful.\n",
      "nice picture, quiet, decent speaker, but the people who wrote the advertising just lied about Netflix functionality.The device is basically useless without support for it.\n",
      "My initial reaction was, \"how on earth is this going to fulfill so many promising latest features\".\n",
      "But it has got so many features within its small little cute body that I wonder why I've been waiting for so many years in search of an economical projector that would beat all the flagships.Here are some of my observations that I've been taken in awe of.1.\n",
      "It's design and size.\n",
      "It's so little.\n",
      "Very strong.\n",
      "Metal speaker grill.\n",
      "Fits on the palm.\n",
      "So easy to carry.2.\n",
      "It's cordless and portable.\n",
      "Recharges very quickly and can run both completely wirelessly or with power cord connected.3.\n",
      "Crystal clear like picture quality.\n",
      "Nothing less than a real LED TV kind.\n",
      "Very clear and crisp video and continuous projection.\n",
      "We may even get confused to television from a distance unless we notice it that it's actually a projected image on the wall.\n",
      "Very bright colors and light.4.\n",
      "Automatic focus in keystone correction.\n",
      "That's something that definitely takes a lot of mental away.\n",
      "Depending on the distance between the projector and the wall or screen it automatically adjust the focus and keystone.\n",
      "We don't have to do anything other than just holding the projector study for like 15 seconds.\n",
      "Coolest feature of all.5.\n",
      "It's Android TV built in.\n",
      "Which means it is smart straight away.\n",
      "We don't have to search for any smart devices too connect to to watch our favorite content.6.\n",
      "It has Google Chromecast built-in.\n",
      "So we can wirelessly mirror the content from our favorite devices also.7.\n",
      "Google Assistant built in.\n",
      "That makes it easy for us to search using voice commands.\n",
      "There is a shortcut key for Google Assistant on the remote controller as well.8.\n",
      "Automatic configuration.\n",
      "Once I enabled the Bluetooth and paired it via Google Assistant, as per their instructions, I was able to connect it to Wi-Fi and then include that into my Google Home devices.\n",
      "It's set up the Google Assistant automatically.9.\n",
      "Audio quality is impeccable as it has Harman kardon speakers built in.\n",
      "I don't question its quality because I love this brand and my car also has the same speakers.\n",
      "So I can imagine what it's like to have a portable Harman kardon speaker cum projector which is cordless in the pocket.10.\n",
      "Many built-in apps and we can add more apps via Google play store.\n",
      "We can stream content from any offer streaming platforms or devices connected via USB port or HDMI port.It is a simply amazing projector that I have ever seen which comes under well within the budget compared to any premium wired projectors.\n",
      "In my opinion it's surely a flagship killer.There is one more thing that they could have added.\n",
      "A storage and carry bag.\n",
      "This kind of premium quality device needs protection during travel.\n",
      "They could have added that small piece making it a complete package.\n",
      "Absolutely love this projector and recommend.Prior to this purchase, I tried 2 cheaper projectors both running on Android as well and they were painfully slow.\n",
      "This projector is super fast with no lag even with switching between apps.Picture:feels like ultra HD 4k quality.\n",
      "Definitely clearer than my 70inch Samsung 2018 model.\n",
      "I've used this projector close where screen size is around 12 inches and as far as making it up to 14ft and both show extremely clear.\n",
      "For outside viewing it is best in the late afternoon or evening, earlier in the day would require some shade as it isn't bright enough to compete with bright sunlight.I've projected onto a vinyl fence, the inside of my garage door, as well as my pergola canopy, and each show super clear despite textured surfaces.\n",
      "Don't think you necessarily need to have a screen to enjoy.Auto adjustment is great as well.\n",
      "Anytime the projector is moved it auto calibrates the picture for you.Sound:Harmon kardon speakers are great.\n",
      "Indoors it's pretty loud but if you have a few people over you may want to connect an additional speaker.\n",
      "Outside it's not bad wish it could be slightly louder but definitely able to enjoy in a normal suburban neighborhood.After thoughts :I don't use the remote it came with being I plug in my Bluetooth keyboard which works perfect with it.\n",
      "The overall design is good, I've mostly used on table tops as I do move it around so I wish it had the ability to tilt rather than having to prop something under it to get a little angle to it.\n",
      "Simple to use and light weight design.\n",
      "I used Netflix, hbo max, YouTube, with no issues.\n",
      "We have a super nice movie where my husband and I love to watch movies, but the problem we were having is our kids were constantly invading it.\n",
      "It would result in them watching a cartoon and our movie room while we watched our movie on a regular TV.\n",
      "We decided to invest in this gadget to create their own space for movie viewing.\n",
      "We did it for them, but also for us.\n",
      "We used the space where they already were using to lounging and playing video games, surrounded by their things and their toys.\n",
      "So since they already had a comfortable seat and their things, all they needed was a blank wall.Set up was easy.\n",
      "We are Apple users and we were concerned at first that we weren‚Äôt going to be able to use it the way we wanted, but all we needed was an adapter that plugged into an iPad and connected to HDMI.\n",
      "This is something we actually already had.We were impressed instantly with the quality of the sound and image.\n",
      "The image quality is crisp and adjusts automatically depending on your space.\n",
      "We have the projector sitting about 12 feet from the wall, not sure how much closer or further we can move it forward to adjust this perfectly.\n",
      "It has customizable settings for brightness, and it even allows 3-D. We didn‚Äôt realize that so that was a nice surprise!\n",
      "The quality of the sound was also very impressive.\n",
      "I‚Äôm not going to suggest that it is as good as my state of the art movie room, but to be in a standalone small unit like this it‚Äôs pretty freaking amazing.\n",
      "My kids were certainly pleased and I would be to given the price point if this is all we had.So if you were looking for an instant movie room, this is what this is.\n",
      "You don‚Äôt need a screen, just the wall, a Phone, possibly an adapter, and a streaming account and you are in business.If you like to travel, it does come with plug-ins that are compatible with two foreign countries, I didn‚Äôt look at them in detail so I can‚Äôt tell you where, but it‚Äôs so portable that might be something that could be a benefit.\n",
      "This is truly an amazing projector.\n",
      "It is a very handy all in one device.\n",
      "We have a basement home theater with an old 720p Panasonic and while I still consider the picture quality to be good for its resolution, it is a large machine and fixed in position because it needs to be wired for everything.\n",
      "I have been wanting to both upgrade our resolution and get something portable that can function as more of a stand alone device.\n",
      "This projector has met and exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "It is the first projector I have tried that outperforms my my aging one.The picture quality is incredible in its brightness, high contrast ratio and resolution.\n",
      "That was surprising to me for such a compact device.\n",
      "The picture quality through the apps or connected device is crisp and bright.\n",
      "It is a great native 1080p projector and even supports 4K ultra HD.\n",
      "It is best in a dark room but still bright easy to see in low lighting with connected power.\n",
      "When I cast my android device through the google home app, the picture is slightly lower resolution but still good.\n",
      "The convenience of being able to cast from a phone, or other connected device outweighs any downgrade in resolution for me.\n",
      "To get the higher resolution, one can easily connect a portable device, like a fire TV stick and keep that portability and clarity.The built in Harmon Kardon speaker has great sound quality, very loud and full sound.\n",
      "I do not find that I need additional speakers to be able to enjoy a movie.\n",
      "For when I do want to use surround sound, I do love the convenience of having Bluetooth connectivity, which allows me to use a Bluetooth speaker system and not have wires all over the place.\n",
      "Bluetooth pairing was straightforward and quick for me to set up.\n",
      "There is also an auxiliary connection for sound.It really is a great stand-alone device, especially with its built in battery that allows it to be used without connected power.\n",
      "I should note that the picture is slightly less bright on battery power to conserve battery, but not much.\n",
      "The battery life is sufficient for me to be able to enjoy a movie, which will be handy for when we use it outside.\n",
      "I absolutely love the quick autofocus and vertical keystone correction.\n",
      "It ensures that my projected image is crisp and clear at all times.\n",
      "Horizontal keystone correction is done manually, but easy to do if it is needed.\n",
      "I tend to centrally locate the projector on a table in front on me and find the horizontal correction unnecessary.\n",
      "Since the cooling fan is so quiet while it is running, there is no distraction from fan noise, having the projector close by.I am finding it to be very user-friendly with a variety of ways to use it.\n",
      "Being a smart projector it has several apps like Google Play, Disney, etc.\n",
      "available for direct streaming.\n",
      "Basically anything you can view on a chrome cast device, you can access with this projector.\n",
      "Netflix, Prime and Hulu are not yet directly available, however, these can be accessed easily through either screen casting or with a connected HDMI device like a fire TV stick.\n",
      "They are working on the licensing to make those extensions available.\n",
      "The projector is also able to play from portable hard drives if you have downloaded content.Overall, I am thrilled with this projector.\n",
      "The performance is incredible and it has exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "After a lot of research I finally pulled the trigger on XGimi Mogo Pro.\n",
      "I actually compared three highly rated portable projectors hands-on before finalizing on this champ.\n",
      "I ordered XGimi Mogo Pro, Nebula Capsule 2 and Nebula Solar Portable.\n",
      "Finally kept XGimi Mogo Pro.\n",
      "Here are my ratings on each.XGimi Mogo Pro -Picture quality - 5/5Sound- 4/5Portability-5/5Connections - 4/5 (@ this price USB-C would have been preferred over 19V DC charger)Fan Noise- 4/5Auto focus - 5/5Operating system - 3.5/5 (Android TV sometimes goes in trance mode and has no clue what it is doing.\n",
      "I have hooked latest Google TV dongle, and it works smoothly.\n",
      ")Build Quality - 4/5 (3.5 mm audio jack seems to be messed up on the hardware I received.\n",
      "Spits out 3.5 mm extension cable as port is not flushed properly with the body.\n",
      "Lets see if XGimi guys resolve the issue after reading this review)Nebula Capsule II -Picture quality - 3/5 (Obviously!\n",
      "Nebula II is only 720P, Mogo Pro and Solar are 1080P)Sound- 10/5 (Yes!\n",
      "nothing comes close to Capsule II in sound.\n",
      "Hands down it has the best sound.\n",
      ")Portability-6/5 (Yes!\n",
      "Its very solid and very portable)Connections - 5/5 (USB-C for charging, that is great!\n",

      "For its size and 1080P resolution it is no brainer againts Nebula line up.\n",
      "If Nebula Capsule II was 1080P, I would keep Capsule II over XGimi Mogo Pro.\n",
      "Nebula Solar Portable is bulky compared to other two so that is out.Other toughts: USB-C is missing.\n",
      "Addition of case would have been great!\n",
      "This really isn't the fault of XGIMI, but hardware-wise, this is almost perfect.\n",
      "It's quiet, the brightness is adjustable by color, the remote is great.\n",
      "The fan is audible with the maximum brightness set, but if you have any sound going, you won't really notice it unless it's right next to you.\n",
      "I noticed a little stuttering with 4K youtube, but I'm not sure why it's running at 4K to begin with.\n",
      "The native resolution is 1080P.The biggest problem is that I can't play Netflix on this machine.\n",
      "I've looked far and wide, and the reason is because Netflix blocks it, you can sideload the Android (phone) app, but the Android TV app doesn't work.\n",
      "I can't even cast Netflix to it!\n",
      "So if you don't use Netflix, this machine is perfect, Prime Video, Disney+, YouTube, anything else you use should work - just not Netflix.\n",
      "Picture quality is fantastic for such a small devise.\n",
      "We had it hooked up to our wireless cable box to play live game out side.\n",
      "Picture quality in the dark was as good as our TV.\n",
      "I did a lot of research before making this purchase and hesitated getting this one due the Netflix issue.\n",
      "Looked at all the top portable mini projectors and I‚Äôm happy that we got this one.\n",
      "Here are basic overview:Pros:Wow factorWireless/WiFiSuper easy and simple to useRechargeable batteryCan play while chargingPicture quality -fantastic in the darkAuto adjust and focus4-6feet from screen to project 120‚Äù Recommend 100‚Äù but 120‚Äù  picture quality was finePrime, peacock, you tube, and other apps and great picture qualitySuper portableBluetooth/ connect to speakersEasy remoteCons:Not bright enough (can‚Äôt see images in day light or well lit room)Netflix-extra step to set it up and poor picture quality via Netflix due to method of connection- pre loaded apps are fineCan‚Äôt use it without remote (forgot to pack remote and could really use it since you can‚Äôt control the device without remote)Little pricySound- not loud enough for outdoor party.\n",
      "Can use Bluetooth to connect to speaker but there is lag in the sound.\n",
      "Ok for games but not so great when watching movies since sound and mouth is out of syncFor best picture quality use wires, we streamed Netflix via hdmi input (wireless cable box) and picture quality was fantastic.\n",
      "Preloaded app picture quality is great only Netflix is not so great.\n",
      "We projected onto screen and directly against our gray siding.\n",
      "Both methods were great.\n",
      "(Better with screen but wasn‚Äôt a big deal without it).\n",
      "Definitely recommend!\n",
      "I‚Äôm giving this 4 stars only because of the sound quality of the speakers.\n",
      "Very weak and tinny sounding.\n",
      "I have a JBL Charge 3 I Bluetooth with so it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much.\n",
      "So many cheap Bluetooth speakers on the market with great sound, plus you can position the speakers near the screen.\n",
      "I would almost prefer this to not come with speakers and all and come in a smaller form factor.\n",
      "Picture quality is... incredible.\n",
      "My brother has the LG portable projector and I‚Äôd say the image on this is crisper.\n",
      "Haven‚Äôt used it outdoors but in a dark room the 300 ANSI lumens are enough.\n",
      "When only used for a 50-70 inch picture it almost appears 4K.\n",
      "There are several reasons why I love this projector.\n",
      "Gives terrific picture.\n",
      "Gives out good sound.\n",
      "Very reasonable battery life before having to charge again.\n",
      "One thing I would love to see is a way to direct the imaging to the ceiling so that the fan in back of the device is not blocked from air flow.\n",
      "Pricey..but love it.\n",
      "Nice device.\n",
      "Its most important advantage is the image resolution and compact body.\n",
      "The sound is clear, but not very low frequencies (not very suitable for listening to music).\n",
      "It seems to me that the manufacturer has not fully disclosed the capabilities of the device.\n",
      "What I would do: add the ability to voice control the device, turn the projector on and off (similar to the work of smart speakers with a built-in voice assistant).\n",
      "It is imperative to make separate use of the device as a smart speaker and as a projector.\n",
      "Therefore, now you have to turn on the device and control it from the remote control, and there is no way to just listen to music without turning on the projector (the projector is always turned on when the device is turned on).\n",
      "In total, I would have implemented: 1) added a subwoofer for more pronounced low frequencies 2) added a voice assistant and separate use of device functions (speaker, projector);  3) (optional) display with the ability to display time, emotions, etc.\n",
      "(but not just an LCD, but with separate large \"pixels\" throughout the body (its part).\n",
      "This projector setup was quick and easy.\n",
      "Able to access Amazon Prime, Disney plus and my other apps without any problems.\n",
      "The projector has auto focus and throws a great image.\n",
      "I was watching an 80 inch image with the Halo about 7 feet away from the wall.\n",
      "The sound worked well for movies in our basement entertainment area without needing extra speakers.\n",
      "Looking forward to using outside during summer nights and parties.\n",
      "Will also be used in an RV during trips.\n",
      "Would definitely recommend for someone looking for a nice compact quality projector.\n",
      "I ordered Xgimi Mogo Pro and Nebula Capsule II after reading lot of great reviews for both these amazing portable projectors.\n",
      "In my first impression Xgimi Mogo Pro is a very good portable projector for its prise to watch movies and entertain your friends and families during those movie nights inside your home or outside in a backyard!\n",
      "Very light weight with amazing picture quality and built in android tv to access great variety  of entertainment on your finger tips.\n",
      "I personally think Mogo pro has a little better, crisp picture quality than Nebula Capsule II with very good auto focus lenses, but Capsule II beats Mogo Pro on the audio performance with comparatively better in built bass.\n",
      "I decided to go with Mogo considering how much my kids like and enjoy it..Reason for 1 less star - no native Netflix app & sound system\n",
      "Wow!!\n",
      "I am shocked at the quality and picture of this mini projector.\n",
      "The setup is simple when you first plug it in the setup wizard walks you through the setup.\n",
      "It is an Android TV and has all of the major apps ready to go.\n",
      "The projector finds the corners of the screen and adjusts the size accordingly.\n",
      "The projector also auto focuses itself.\n",
      "The picture is very bright, clear and crisp.\n",
      "I have a large ceiling mounted projector that was about 4 times the price from a major brand and we all agree that this mini projector has a better picture.\n",
      "The projector is small and compact and is easy to transport and store .\n",
      "The sound is ok it does get very loud but it is nothing special.\n",
      "Hook a sound at to it and you have an awesome theater.\n",
      "Overall I am thrilled with the quality and picture of this mini projector.\n",
      "This is the second XGIMI portable projector we ever gotten.\n",
      "The first one is the CC Dark Knight which we are very satisfied with what it can offer.\n",
      "MoGo is such a wonderful upgrade and improvement in picture which supports video format up to 4K Ultra HD.\n",
      "This tiny and elegant portable projector has certainly transformed our home entertainment to the next level as we have been using it in our living room, so basically we watch everything on it, movies, TV series, Youtube videos and etc.\n",
      "It has been about two weeks since we received MoGo and it has not yet disappointed us.\n",
      "The set up with pairing both the remote control and our Google account were instant.\n",
      "We were surprised to see a sharp and crisp image from such a compact projector.\n",
      "Another excitement is the 210 ANSI Lumen power delivering cinematic images with fantastic clarity.\n",
      "The next thing we wanna try out is to connect via Bluetooth with our B&O speaker so that we could have movie night with friends and family during the xmas holiday.\n",
      "The MoGo is a great investment for us and the bundle promotion with tripod was a definitely a plus.\n",
      "Wanted to test this projector out a few months before leaving a review.\n",
      "The picture quality is pretty good.\n",
      "Very bright in a lowlight setting, but the chromecast feature is awful.\n",
      "It skips every few seconds.\n",
      "I had to attach my own chromecast which looks super weird hanging from the back.\n",
      "Very disappointed because that was a major reason I made the purchase of this almost $600 projector.\n",
      "The hulu app also skips a lot!\n",
      "Which it was better.\n",
      "Needs a zoom feature & shut-off timer!\n",
      "Compared to other cheap Chinese made projectors, this one is pretty good.\n",
      "Picture is good but not great, wifi connection is great mirroring works 90% of the time so far.\n",
      "Auto focus is great be picture still look soft but if figure that is to this model being a lower quality projector and not 1080p or 4k.\n",
      "But makes a great outdoor/indoor movie night.\n",
      "Even if you have some light coming in from the window, you can still see the image well.\n",
      "With the projector on my tripod and about 8ft away the screen size is nice and large.\n",
      "Sound of the speakers is nice and loud but hardly no bass, I have my Boss desktop speakers pulled into the the headphone jack and with that I have my own home theater.\n",
      "Contrast is on the gray side.\n",
      "Apps work well with this, so far only try YouTube and Disney plus.\n",
      "Everything is great but there is a flashing sound that comes sometimes , like the bulb is about to crack or something , this came twice till now and I am still seeing if this is worth to keep .I will call xgimi support\n",
      "This is probably the best projector at this price range.\n",
      "The fact it has a built in battery, speakers and auto focus makes this a great deal.\n",
      "Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt have Netflix support, however, it‚Äôs not a big issue since you can use a Roku or fire tv stick.\n",
      "I do like that you can pair a Bluetooth speaker for louder sound, but the built in is not so bad when use at home.The picture quality is great at larger sizes, no blur at 90‚Äù  screen size.\n",
      "This is a great projector by Xgimi.\n",
      "I am looking into the H2 at a future date.My only complaint and reason for the the four out of five stars is that on the top there is a spot that appears to be from wear.\n",
      "I‚Äôve only had the projector for a few days and was surprised by it.\n",
      "It doesn‚Äôt appear to be used, but it did cross my mind.\n",
      "ProPortablePicture quality is good 1080PLots of apps can be installed for google TV(Netflix has to be installed with xtv)Build in speaker is loud and clear, better than TV sound barConnot that bright, you have to use the project at night or in a dark roomalso do not plan to use this project watch content that has a lot of black sceneIt's a google TV thing, that bluetooth connection always try to the last bluetooth device you used,  this is annoying if you  do not want to use that bluetooth device any more.\n",
      "I do not see an option to forget/delete a bluetooth device once connected.\n",
      "My family was flabbergasted how good picture quality is for the size.Also, it is fast.\n",
      "OS Menu navigation and apps work much faster than my on 2019 Samsung TV.First start and configuration is soo easy with google account.\n",
      "It even paired to the active Wi-Fi on my phone by himself.In general build quality is high.\n",
      "Even remote controller feels good.- Closer than 2 meters, you will see a grid of pixels.- Sound quality is average.- No native Netflix support.\n",
      "Only via another app.\n",
      "But in general it works.- Internet connection via Wi-Fi is accidentally lost.\n",
      "Sometimes after 5 minutes of work, sometimes after 1 hour.\n",
      "I‚Äôm pretty blown away at how good this projector is.\n",
      "Image looks amazing for a battery powered projector.\n",
      "First thing I watched was the beginning of the movie Bumblebee.\n",
      "And if you don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs a great test for with its fast paced light and dark scenes and explosions.\n",
      "The projector handled it perfectly in 1080!Sound is also very good.\n",
      "Clear and plenty loud like a high quality Bluetooth speaker.4/5 stars because it‚Äôs Android specific device.\n",
      "Doesn‚Äôt play well with apple.\n",
      "Even with chromecast app installed on phone.\n",
      "The only thing I could get to wirelessly screen mirror was YouTube.\n",
      "(A google app)An HDMI to lightning adapter works flawlessly from my phone or iPad.\n",
      "Which is what I planned on doing anyway.Great product.\n",
      "Highly recommend\n",
      "*UPDATEI bought a defective one previously, now I got a good one.\n",
      "It‚Äôs great.\n",
      "If it cannot get auto-focus, don‚Äôt doubt, it‚Äôs defective.Overall, it‚Äôs the best at the level of $500.\n",
      "I tried a lot of Chinese brand, they‚Äôre all great at their price.\n",
      "This one Xgimi, especially is the best at it‚Äôs level of price.\n",
      "The Speaker is great and is good to play in bedroom.\n",
      "I feel a strong sense of surround.\n",
      "The picture is at a high level of 1080p.\n",
      "*i won‚Äôt delete this review*This is the worst portable projector I‚Äôve ever seen.The auto focus doesn‚Äôt work at all.\n",

      "I have XGIMI CC Mini Projector Portable 350 projector, and need another one.\n",
      "After comparing CC Mini 350 with MoGo, I found MoGo's image quality is not good.\n",
      "Especially the color is washed out.\n",
      "I know CC Mini 350 is a more expensive device, and it is not fair to compare both devices.\n",
      "I feel this MoGo projector is good for business power point, not good for video playback.\n",
      "This is a wonderful although pricey device.\n",
      "The picture is sharp, colors present well and brightness is very good.\n",
      "Although best used in the dark or low light, it is watchable with ambient daylight in a room.\n",
      "I have used this outdoors and indoors.\n",
      "And I‚Äôve cast streaming from iPhone and connected a Roku, all with no issues.\n",
      "YouTube Tv also works fine.\n",
      "I give it 4 stars only because I can‚Äôt give 4.5.\n",
      "The downside is that the user interface is not very intuitive and the same with the remote.\n",
      "Overall, for me, well worth the money.\n",
      "The sound coming from the device is just meh so I bought a sound bar for the bedroom.\n",
      "Now it is no different from a theater.\n",
      "My only complaint is the Netflix app doesn't work and you have to deploy a work around.\n",
      "It is about what you expect for 200 ANSI lumens, you can't really use it in daylight.\n",
      "But a darkened room works just fine.\n",
      "I am pleased with the purchase for the price.\n",
      "The side casting or ceiling casting settings are impossible to figure out\n",
      "So far it‚Äôs great.\n",
      "I am happy with the colors and picture quality.\n",
      "It also has a variety of picture settings.\n",
      "The sound is great as well.\n",
      "The only thing is that it does not have Netflix.I got a firestick and tried this way but the sound won‚Äôt come through.Also I was in between this and the latest nebula and this is way better.\n",
      "Really happy with the Xgimi Mogo Pro thus far.\n",
      "I got it to watch movies with the family in the yard on the weekends given the summer and covid.\n",
      "Picture is great and built in Android TV with Google Assistant work great.\n",
      "The UI for me is instantly familiar and I was up and running quickly.\n",
      "I connected my UE Blueooth speaker with no issues and set it right behind our seating for that surround sound feeling.\n",
      "Prime, HBO Max and Disney Plus work natively with no problem.I had to plug in a chromecast for Netflix movies which was a bit of a bummer but the chromecast allowed for me to use my Xfinity mobile tv app which ended up being a bonus for Shark Week!I reached out to Xgimi support and Ari responded right away around my questions when Netflix will be supported.\n",
      "sounds like it's more of a licensing support issue and not a technical issues.\n",
      "I am hopeful this will be resolved soon but the chromecast was an easy fix for me and carries the bonus of being able to use your local cable provider's mobile live tv app.\n",
      "We use the projector twice a week in our back yard after dinner.\n",
      "Autofocus is a must and it is great at it.\n",
      "Connected to the internet, you can download most streaming services.\n",
      "Also can connect by HDMI to DVD player and to my MacBook.\n",
      "Easy to use.\n",
      "More expensive, and worth it.\n",
      "So Far I like everything this proyector has Android TV 9.0 built so you have 2 units for the price of one, you dont need to conect a Rocku or Fire stick to watch movies since it has it build in.There is a minor issue with Netflix but after a while will be corrected to do with licensing etc.The unit has a beautiful 1080p picture self focus and amazing speaker Harman-Kardon strongly recommend this unit\n",
      "Todo esta perfecto con ese proyector portatil vives unas experiencia √∫nica muy lindo\n",
      "I bought this projector ad a birthday gift for my wife and she loved it.\n",
      "We are using it in our bedroom where we do not have a tv installed.\n",
      "Quality and resolution of projected images are outstanding at a projection distance of 3.5 meters in a dark room.\n",
      "It‚Äôs like to be at the cinema.\n",
      "We enjoy films and tv shows using some enterteinment apps like Amazon prime video.\n",
      "My wife often travel for work, and she is taking mogo pro with her to project her presentations connecting it through a hdmi cable to her notebook.\n",
      "She is very satisfied, it‚Äôs very portabile!\n",
      "Moreover, we connected mogo pro to our iphone through a hdmi adaptor, to project our pictures and home made videos: so easy to use - the room should be a bit dark to enjoy the quality of the pictures.\n",
      "The battery duration is reasonnable: sometimes we had to connect mogo pro to the power supply to complete watching the movie.\n",
      "Finally, mogo pro has bluetooth: perfect to connect AirPods and watch movies without waking up our child!\n",
      "Definitely suggested!\n",
      "This is an awesome projector, a bit pricey but totally worth it if you get it on sale like I did.\n",
      "The autofocus feature is my favorite thing about this.\n",
      "I have had a couple of cheaper manual projectors in the past and you could never get it 100% focused.\n",
      "This looks very crisp at 1080p even on a bare wall.\n",
      "The onboard speakers are actually pretty decent if you‚Äôre inside but another feature that I really like is the ability to connect Bluetooth speakers to it.\n",
      "Makes for a great portable setup.\n",
      "Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre in the market.\n",
      "Was a bit skeptical about this mini projector but wanted to give it a chance.\n",
      "I wanted to use it as a bedroom TV but the place where it can me placed is on a ledge 90 degrees from the wall I want to project to.\n",
      "The manual keystone controls did the trick and gets exactly what I want!\n",
      "Android TV is smooth and familiar since I also have a NVIDIA Shield.\n",
      "Remote is much better than average and wireless is a big plus.\n",
      "Then only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is Netflix not yet certified to work.\n",
      "If that happens, will gladly update to 5 stars.\n",
      "I don't think there is a better mini projector with built in android TV (and I looked at the Nebula units...)\n",
      "This projector is AMAZING.\n",
      "The picture quality is phenomenal and the sound from the built-in speaker is high-quality (for being built into the projector).\n",
      "It's small - the size of a Sonos speaker - so you can easily move it around to any room in the house, or take it outdoors for a fun movie night.\n",
      "The battery life is awesome and you can easily watch 2 movies on one full charge.\n",
      "I'm so happy with this projector - it's already brought countless nights of fun to my family watching movies on the deck since we can't go to the theater anymore!\n",
      "Super portable, with crazy power.\n",
      "Instantly transform your room into a theater.\n",
      "Great quality sound, easily connects to Bluetooth speakers, tucks away in corners and gives a huge high quality picture.\n",
      "Still does not have a working Netflix app through Android but there are a few easy work arounds.\n",
      "This even loads VPN apps to watch stateside apps abroad.\n",
      "A must have for the work/travelers.\n",
      "I purchased an Manfrotto tripod and a carry case.\n",
      "I really want to love this little projector, but it has a couple of big flaws:1.\n",
      "Netflix doesn't work at all (unless you chromecast from a laptop), and Hulu kind of works but the video freezes every 5 minutes or so (for about 5 seconds), which is really annoying.2.\n",
      "The cable is really big and heavy, and I really wish it were a standard USB-C, which would make it much more portable.Otherwise the projector is great in terms of picture quality, interface, portability, etc.\n",
      "Excelente inversi√≥n, brillo lo que me esperaba, el precio un poco alto, me encanta que android powered, se puede hacer mirror desde el celular con netflix, calidad n√≠tida, la mejor inversi√≥n que hecho en este tipo de dispositivos, f√°cil de usar y ligero, la bater√≠a si no dura mucho casi las 2 horas, lo recomiendo\n",
      "Netflix and Hulu does not work on this.\n",
      "The light is too dim to watch during the day.\n",
      "Overall super convenient but not worth the money.\n",
      "Product failed to function as advertised not more that a week after my return window expired.\n",

      "Bought a case to carry it and wow how easy to storage anywhere.\n",
      "Arrived well packaged and very easy to set up right out of the box.\n",
      "I tried it with an hdmi connection first and then with a usb drive.\n",
      "Both were effortless to understand and worked right away the usb took a sec longer to respond.\n",
      "This projector is lighter weight.\n",
      "The bigger the room, the better the picture and sound!\n",
      "I have tried many portable projectors and XGIMI MOGO stands out from the rest.What I like the most:- Compact- Good sound- Amazing auto focus- Good picture quality- Love the additional manual focus in the remote- The side projection mode automatically corrects the picture keytone (absolutely love it).Have been bragging with friends and they all love this unit\n",
      "I really liked the picture quality but the speed of everything loading and fact the you can only use the remove to enter information one digit at a time is old fashion, needs modern upgrades to justify the price.\n",
      "Also it needs to build in smart TV futures to stay ahead of competition.\n",
      "White color on screen is a bit too white3D not working properly and is no option to change the 3D polarityVery poor battery lifeFor 600$ I expected something moreBut is a best portable projector I have so far\n",
      "Purchase the Mogo Pro a few days, return the nebula capsule 2 for issues with the nebula, then I saw the Mogo Pro was already available in amazon for purchased, I get it right away, got wrong video settings, get support for Xgimi with the right video settings, Voila !!!!\n",
      "picture quality is now way better , even in a drywall with no screen and some lights around, so I am pretty happy with the purchased now, carrying case will be available soon and future updates promises amazon prime and Netflix as a native android tv  apps\n",
      "Just exactly what I was looking for.\n",
      "1080p smart projector on Android TV.\n",

      "Workaround is also tedious to install.\n",
      "I would not recommend buying if you use it for netflix.\n",

      "It flickers frequently.\n",
      "In the end of my upload video, it shuts off automatically and then recovers.\n",
      "This problem happens very frequently.\n",
      "+ Great size and build.+ Sound quality exceeding my expectation for its size.+ Picture/video quality looks good.\n",
      "No apparent color/focus issues.- Fan is noisy and disturbing.\n",
      "* Wish it has longer battery life, for a long movie.\n",
      "* Wish it has usb-c for charging.\n",
      "I guess I got the bad one out of the bunch...battery life wasn't what it should and that was the main thing I need since I would b traveling with the device...picture was great and sound was ok...sent item back for exchange but no stock...\n",
      "the good thing is very easy to use , bad thing is not to clear the image and the battery only last 2 hours .\n",

      "I never write product reviews but I am so happy with this device that I feel the need to write this one.\n",

      "My one complaint is it doesn't charge via usb-c\n",

      "Good product.\n",
      "Worth the money.\n",
      "Android tv should support all the apps\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "Loving the Mogo Pro\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Here are my Pros: Overall you cannot get all these features in any other projector at this price point.\n",
      "Picture quality is fantastic you can definitely see that it is 1080p.\n",
      "I love the autofocus and the vertical and horizontal keystone as I project from the side onto the wall.All that being said here are my Cons: The \"high quality Harmon Kardon\" do not offer very much volume, the sound is flat and tingy when it tries to get to higher volumes.\n",
      "I've had sound drop issues as well.The picture has been great when it works.\n",
      "I have had multiple instances where the entire image pixelates and the image drops out.\n",
      "On high brightness the picture is extremely Green in color.\n",
      "Due to the lumens on this protector it struggles with dim scenes in movies.I hooked up my Roku stick with this projector and to my surprise there is no sound out.\n",
      "The only reason I hooked up my Roku was for the lack of support of Netflix which can still be worked around through other apps on Android TV that is built into the MOGO Pro.In my opinion at this price point the issues with sound and picture should be unacceptable.\n",
      "I'll be returning this and continuing my search for a projector with similar features.Update: I've messaged Xgimi and their techs have solved the problem with the sound drop out and the problem of no sound from my Roku Express.\n",
      "This is good except that Bluetooth is garbled when connected to a Bluetooth speaker or when using Bluetooth with the HDMI port.\n",
      "There are MANY remaining issues with this projector.\n",
      "The screen pixelation that occurs on YouTube, Xgimi acknowledged this was a problem and said it will be in a patch in the future.\n",
      "I didn't get a timeline for that so in the meantime I'll just use the Roku for YouTube.\n",
      "I was going to keep this but I kept running into more software snags Xgimi said they were aware and that it would be in an upcoming update but couldn't give me an estimated timeline for when I should expect it to be fixed.\n",
      "In addition there are issues with Hulu playback where the image is frozen but there is still sound playing.\n",
      "My question is, why do they advertise that Hulu, YouTube and Netflix works when they clearly don't.\n",
      "Don't advertise if the experience isn't available.Get an Epson 2100 or 2150.\n",
      "It's no portable but I got mine refurbished from Amazon for less than the Xgimi MOGO Pro.\n",
      "There quality is leaps and bounds above Xgimi.\n",
      "I plug in my Roku express and I'm blown away by the projector colors and brightness.\n",
      "This is bulkier and it's not smart but for the picture that it puts out 1000% better than the MOGO Pro.\n",
      "Also Google is going to be releasing its own android TV dongle later this year.\n",
      "Then my Epson 2100 will be essentially the same as Xgimi except better because it will support every app in the play store.\n",
      "This is our first projector.\n",
      "I bought it directly from their official site during their promotion.\n",
      "It is perfect for kids to watch it in the room.\n",
      "I think it is bright enough for in the evening even with a bit light on.Pros:1.\n",
      "The fan is pretty quiet.2.\n",
      "The sound quality is good.3.\n",
      "Android TV and chromecast system is good.\n",
      "You can actually play youtube, disney+, Amazon Prime.\n",
      "(But not netflix)4.\n",
      "Voice control5.\n",
      "It comes with three kinda plugs for different countries.\n",
      "And it works with 110-240v6.\n",
      "The size is pretty compact.\n",
      "Like a half galleon milk and 2/3 height.Cons:1.\n",
      "It has auto focus.\n",
      "But it doesn't work perfectly every time.2.\n",
      "Smart keystone adjustment doesn't seem to work either.\n",
      "I can adjust it manually.3.\n",
      "no Netflix.\n",
      "(You can't run it directly with the official version)4.\n",
      "You can't move the image up or down.\n",
      "You can physically adjust the machine.5.\n",
      "You can't control it from your phone app.\n",
      "It does come with a remote.Overall I like it when it is at discount price that is cheaper than Nebula Apollo.I uploaded two photo I took when I projected it to my wall.\n",
      "One with light on and one with light off.\n",
      "(light is on top which is very close to the part of wall I projected) There is a small light in a far corner in both cases.\n",
      "I ordered mine direct from Xgimi and I'm very impressed with it's performance in such a clean, \"apple like\" package.\n",
      "I opted for the non-pro version to save a few bucks and it'll only be for outdoor movie night occasional use.\n",
      "Although the Mogo is only 540P, it's image quality is very good.\n",
      "Movies and video look great, but text is a little jagged, (not blurry), and I imagine you would see improvements in the true HD Pro version.\n",
      "Auto keystone and auto focus works perfectly, a sec or 2 and it self adjusts.\n",
      "The remote control is fluid, no lags, as well as Android TV 9.\n",
      "Truly is a complete package.\n",
      "No more lugging a large projector outdoors, with bluetooth dongle, amazon firestick plugged in, extension cords, etc.\n",
      "I've downloaded all our movie/tv apps, like netflix, disney, prime video, charge it up and we're ready to go.\n",
      "Definitely a keeper!\n",
      "My projector needs are simple:  I don't want a TV taking up space in my apartment, but I have large white expanses of wall and love movies.\n",
      "Enter the Mogo Pro.\n",
      "The picture quality is spot-on.\n",
      "Some HD TVs may have better picture quality, but for the normal viewer, this is spectacular.\n",
      "Sound quality is great, as the Harmon-Kardon heritage would suggest.\n",
      "Software updates are simple, and it connects quite easily to YouTube, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Google Play, and many more.\n",
      "Super easy.\n",
      "It also has plugs for connecting via HDMI to a laptop, but this isn't necessary if you're utilizing a streaming service.\n",
      "The Mogo Pro also contains a standard mounting system, like you'd find on any high end camera, action camera, or GoPro.\n",
      "This means that if you already have a nice tripod you like, you can use this for movie nights!\n",
      "Couldn't be more stoke to have this device and use it for many years :)\n",
      "I backed Mogo Pro through Indigogo.\n",
      "Not having native Netflix support is a fail.\n",
      "The battery on full charge (also less than 10 cycles) barely gets through a 2-hour movie on the standard brightness setting.\n",
      "Auto Keystone Correction does not work on my unit now and the right side fo the picture is slanted higher.\n",
      "Support has been poor in communication and resolving the problem.\n",
      "This is a fantastic projector.1.\n",
      "bright and fills a indoor space perfectly.2.\n",
      "speakers are good, and can fill indoor and outdoor spaces.3.\n",
      "bright enough that you can use it outdoors at night!I carry this projector with me as a work backup.\n",
      "It is so much lighter than the portable work projector that i can put it in my bag and go!Overall setup is simple.\n",
      "AndroidTV gives you the power of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon prime video native to the device.I think the one thing that I truly find remarkable is the sound!\n",
      "The speakers are amazing.\n",
      "I've connected to and used them for conference call speakers in a room full of people, because well they are that good!If you are looking for a projector that can fill your home media room, but still go with you on vacation - this is your projector!\n",
      "I have really enjoyed using this projector.\n",
      "It is bright, sharp, has Android TV, is compact & portable, and just fun to use.\n",
      "I have used this for a couple of weeks, and have some thoughts.\n",
      "I was able to get a 10% coupon by signing up for XGIMI's mailing list, and for $500, this is a great buy.The Pros:-The MoGo Pro is very small and portable without compromising on image quality.\n",
      "The battery life is also decent.-The automatic focus is really nice to have and saves me time and sanity.\n",
      "You can also manually focus the projector with a switch on the bottom of the remote.-The projected image looks great, is pretty bright, and can go up to around 110\" before the brightness starts to drop off.\n",
      "(This is with the power cable connected)-It has a tripod mount on the bottom, which allows me to throw this on either a Mini Tripod (I used the Manfrotto Pixi) or a full-size tripod.\n",
      "This was almost a necessity for me.-While I prefer Roku, the Android TV interface has pretty much everything that you will need.\n",
      "I really enjoyed using the Plex app with my own content.-The remote is light, easy to use, and feels good in the hand.-It has an audio out jack if you want to hook it up to a home theater system, an external speaker, or some headphones with no noticeable lag.-The projector has Bluetooth, and I was able to connect my Bluetooth headphones, a Bluetooth speaker, and even a Bluetooth keyboard.-I was able to load music and videos on a thumb drive, plug it into the USB port, and play it on the projector.-The projector came in a double-layered package with Silica Gel and high-quality foam.\n",
      "It should make it to you in one piece.The \"Okays\":-The sound quality and volume of the built-in speaker is pretty good, but if there will be much background noise, or the sound needs to travel a long distance, I would recommend connecting an external speaker.-It didn't include batteries for the remote, so make sure that you have a couple of AAA's lying around...-On this projector, a 100\" image is produced from 8-9 feet away.The Cons:-The battery life of the projector could be better.\n",
      "I was able to watch a movie on it just fine, but it didn't have much extra.-The screen brightness drops a bit when on battery power.\n",
      "If you are projecting less than a 100\" screen, you will be fine, but if you plan to go bigger than 90\", you may want to use the power cord.When I was researching projectors, I had some findings that I wanted to share with you.\n",
      "These are not all specific to the MoGo Pro.-First of all, projector brightness marketing is a lie.\n",
      "The XGIMI MoGo Pro advertises 300 ANSI Lumens of brightness.\n",
      "I have a friend who got a projector that claimed 5500 Lumens of brightness.\n",
      "While you would think that my friends' projector would be 18 times brighter than mine, it's really not.\n",
      "And from what I have read, this is not an isolated case.\n",
      "Don't bother with the manufacturers' brightness numbers.\n",
      "If you want to see how bright a projector is, read the reviews.-Second, unless you plan on projecting on the side of your light-colored house, any projection size over 150\" is basically pointless.\n",
      "I understand that a 300\" screen sounds cool, but trust me, 98% of you don't need your projection to be that big, and will never use it that big.\n",
      "I'm not saying to not buy a projector that can go that big.\n",
      "I am saying to not buy a projector JUST because it can go that big.-Third, don't forget that screen size is measured diagonally.\n",
      "If you need to convert height & width to diagonal (or vice-versa), I would recommend finding an online calculator that can do that.-Fourth, don't forget the input.\n",
      "For the MoGo Pro, it has Android TV built-in, which will cover most of your needs, including YouTube, and all of the major streaming services that I know of.\n",
      "However, other projectors may not have Android TV, and before you buy, make sure that you also know how you will get a video to it.\n",
      "The worst thing is to get your shiny new projector and realize that you forgot to buy an HDMI Cable.-Fifth, some projectors may be able to go to big sizes, but the projector will have to be so far away from the screen that it is impossible indoors.\n",
      "Make sure the projector you choose can go to the screen size you want, at a distance that will work with your living space.-Sixth, if you have a light-colored wall, you probably don't need a screen, If you are considering a screen, hold a white sheet of paper up to the wall and compare how the projector on the paper looks to how the wall looks.\n",
      "That will give you a general idea of how much a screen will help.\n",
      "This‚Äôs a great projector with amazing picture quality.\n",
      "Sound quality is superb and fills the room.\n",
      "Ever since I bought this projector, we use TV less because this projector is small enough to be portable and we take it everywhere in the house to watch movies and series.\n",
      "We even carry it when we travel.\n",
      "Moreover, it has all the great features that include auto focus, keystone correction, screen mirroring content from mobiles phones using air screen and much more.\n",
      "Also you can play movies from Netflix and amazon prime videos.\n",
      "Brightness is very good in a dark room.\n",
      "Overall this‚Äôs a great product for the price we pay and we really enjoy watching movies on this projector.\n",
      "You can see the attached pictures, the projector is placed 10 ft from the wall and projected on to white wall in a dark room\n",
      "I bought this mogo directly from Xgimi so that I can use it on movie nights for indoor and outdoor.\n",
      "it has better quality picture, projection size max up to 100\".\n",
      "Mogo is small but powerful android TV projector, can support 1080p 2k and 4k  and the good thing it has a decent quality built in speakers.\n",
      "Great to buy on its price.added review: I also bought mogo pro directly from xgimi, I have noticed that there is a huge difference between the pixels of mogo and mogo pro.\n",
      "but both of them have great image quality.\n",
      "mogo pro is brighter considering it has 300 lumens and 1080p resolution.\n",
      "I projected it to 100inches on my gray wall and it is outstanding!\n",
      "I very like it!\n",
      "a must buy also!\n",
      "This product has a poor brightness to contrast..the make of the product is good but what if it cannot provide you with a good picture quality...i would rather buy LGPF50KA which is a very good and a brighter projector when compared to XGIMI PRO...\n",
      "The quality is good in general, however there are a couple of things which could improve the product.\n",
      "The basic settings can only be operated through the remote control, however the volume cannot be controled with it.\n",
      "Also Netflix is not supported for now.\n",
      "It has different AC adapted but did not include the remote control batteries.\n",
      "Before ordering I was bit skeptical about the quality but it was awesome when I plugged it in a dark room.\n",
      "It is very portable and would recommend a tripod with it to make it really handy.\n",
      "It has auto focus which is very good.\n",
      "It‚Äôs a good small bundle of features.\n",
      "Android TV is a bonus.\n",
      "I am a Kodi guy so it makes it very easy to install and run Kodi on it.\n",
      "It has HDMI port as well so fire stick and usb drive should be other options I will be trying next weekend.\n",
      "In short, a good portable projector.\n",
      "Bought this to replace a Nebula Mars II when the usb port stopped working and couldn't power a FireTV or Chromecast.\n",
      "The Mogo has all the apps I need and casting support built in, so it's an all in one package.\n",
      "Can't recommend this enough.\n",
      "The product seems great.\n",
      "Customer service is not good so far.\n",
      "The product arrived 12/6/19 and I am still Waiting for a remote 1/10/2020.\n",
      "Works wonderful in dark.The brightness and the picture quality is pretty good.Sound fills the room.Super happy and excited to watch more movies on this.Will be updating once I  use the 3D glasses\n",
      "I bought this mogo a few months ago and I am amazed with this device.\n",
      "I did not think the quality would be this great.\n",
      "I received it right away and the quality is excellent!\n",
      "I have this projector and it is fantastic.\n",
      "You can set it up in a few minutes, its bright, has all the android app, and you can chromecast from your phone.\n",
      "Really awesome product!\n",
      "Speaker, good picture, bluetooth and wifi capabilities with the app store.\n",
      "The best projector I have ever had!\n",
      "really best quality , would recommended!!\n",
      "!\n",
      "I so wanted to love this projector but it had one flaw, it DOES NOT work with Netflix!\n",
      "XGIMI customer service told me they are working on a solution but how long is a customer suppose to wait?\n",
      "Netflix is a must and if it won't work, what's the point of having a portable WiFi enabled projector.\n",
      "There were other minor issues... it wouldn't connect to my WiFi immediately and it took almost an hour of chatting with customer service to get the WiFi issue resolved.\n",
      "An electronic device at this price point should just work straight out of the box!\n",
      "So, unfortunately I'll have to return it.\n",
      ":(Good news:Brightness - Awesome!\n",
      "Bright enough that you don't need a screen and can use a wall or other white painted surface.\n",
      "We used the garage door as our backdrop.\n",
      "Blacks get somewhat washed out and it can be difficult to see details when you're watching a dark movie scene (e.g., Ironman, the Winter Soldier - the opening scene when Ironman conducts a raid on the hijacked ship) but I'm sure brightness would improve using a better screen.Sound - Very good!\n",
      "The Harman / Kardon speakers are pretty loud but the bass is a little weak.\n",
      "Perfect if it's just a few of you surrounding the projector.Bluetooth - Works like a champ!\n",
      "Connects to external speakers for a better sound experience.Apps - Good.\n",
      "I didn't try Amazon, but it works with Disney+, YouTube, etc.\n",
      "Like a said at the top, the big NEGATIVE is that this device doesn't work with Netflix.\n",
      "No matter what you try, you will get an error message stating \"this device is not compatible with the Netflix app.\n",
      "\"WiFi - Works.\n",
      "Seemed a bit glitchy at first but was able to add new access points without issue after initial setup.That's it!\n",
      "Good device if you don't need Netflix.\n",
      "I got this projector yesterday and I was really excited to use it, but that quickly turned to frustration.\n",
      "There are two main issues with the software1.\n",
      "You can't install Netflix directly from the Google Play Store, it is incompatible with this device.\n",
      "It sounds like the issue is a licensing problem with Netflix that XGIMI are trying to resolve, so maybe we'll get a fix for this in a future update.\n",
      "So, users are asked to download a third party app that installs a different build of the apk that works with the device.\n",
      "Doing this got me into Netflix, but the cursor would randomly stop responding when trying to scroll through the menus, but I could still select the item I was on.\n",
      "So, with that in mind, we decided to try watching Hulu.\n",
      "Which brings us to2.\n",
      "Hulu video freezes up every 10 seconds or so.\n",
      "The audio will continue to play, but the video will freeze for a few seconds, then it would catch up to the audio again, play normally for a few seconds, and then the video would freeze and repeat this process.\n",
      "Looking through some of the other comments I see this is a common problem for a few other users as well.SO, with those two options out of the picture, we tried using VLC Media Player to stream a movie I have on a network drive and this worked perfectly.\n",
      "The picture quality looks incredible, especially compared to the RIF6 Cube I had been using up until this point.\n",
      "The Harmon Kardon speaker was loud enough that we didn't need to use an external speaker, though I don't think it would hold up in a larger group setting.\n",
      "The remote is nice and easy to use, and it uses bluetooth so you don't have to actually point it at the projector for it to work.TL:DR - The hardware of the projector is solid and the picture quality is outstanding, but the software leaves a lot to be desired.\n",
      "Netflix and Hulu will give you issues if playing directly on the device, but it seems like all my problems will be remedied by simply plugging in a Chromecast and streaming through that instead.\n",
      "Defeated item was delivered and returnedPlus it is very complicated to set up  I couldn't even start to basic set up because it never recognized with any WIFIPlus, there's no other way to seek for help to support this technical question nor problemI don‚Äôt understand why they do not pre-set up like any other mini projectors on the marketJUST DON't BUY it till they progress this problem.\n",
      "I agree that the quality of picture looks good but dim ansi lumen yet\n",
      "First of all, if you don't have internet/wifi, DON'T buy this just thinking it'll be a projector.\n",
      "It NEEDS wifi and a google account before it'll even let you go to the projector mode.\n",
      "It seems to be 50/50 if it'll accept your router even if you do have wifi.\n",
      "Most Android TVs have a 'Skip' button on the wifi and google account setups, not so here.\n",
      "I couldn't tell you what the reasoning is behind that.\n",
      "The other thing that isn't mentioned in the product description that I feel is super important is that 3D DOES NOT WORK in four-corner keystone mode.\n",
      "This is a common thing with lower cost projectors and honestly I didn't think I had to ask here because this is not a low cost projector and not some knockoff company selling them, but apparently I really should have.\n",
      "I didn't really test anything else, after being so annoyed by the wifi not connecting at my house and not even being able to test it (And having to drag the thing to a friend's house on the random chance it might like his router, which for some reason it did) only to IMMEDIATELY find out that the most important thing to me is disabled when I'm projecting in the only mode I'll ever be projecting in because it's a PORTABLE projector.\n",
      "It's critical to be able to project from any angle and still have access to all the features I'm paying for.\n",
      "Also you can't set up the keystone correction until after you log in via the internet, so prepare to be pretty annoyed using the onscreen keyboard to type in wifi info and google accounts (Especially if you end up having to do it multiple times like I did) if you don't have a straight-on surface handy to set it up with.\n",
      "I have been looking for a good projector for a while since kids learning from home.\n",
      "This projector shows its quality.\n",
      "I use it to connect computer for kids' screen time trying to reduce damage caused by regular monitor.I did not use projector screen and the definition is clear for kids to see.It is small I can move it to living room anytime to have a movie or game.It also support Android TV which is good to watch more programs.\n",
      "Love this portable projector.\n",
      "So far I have used this on four different occasions (cabin trips and at home).\n",
      "Perfect for group settings, and makes the it a more intimate.The picture is amazing for its price point.\n",
      "It stretches up to 100 inches and can customized to your liking.\n",
      "The sound is good, but I connect it to my sonos move, to make the home theatre experience come to life.Battery life is decent, last up to 2 hours wirelessly.\n",
      "I have not run into any issues with that as I did purchase a power bank to prevent it from dying early.The best part of this device is it‚Äôs built in chromecast.\n",
      "Can literally watch anything you want using the projector.\n",
      "Along with built in chromcast, comes with all the android apps, including Disney plus, Hulu, hbo, and thousands more ready to download.\n",
      "This is very easy to use, the user manual explains how to use it very well.\n",
      "It is very light in terms of weight.\n",
      "I use it mainly for business presentations and I would use it again in  the future.\n",
      "Make sure you adjust the level in the program to get a smooth experience.\n",
      "I have been in the market for a portable projector that can be battery powered and used wherever we go.\n",
      "The projector came super fast, and was very easy to get going.\n",
      "The device works well and is great for movie nights.\n",
      "I have watched sports and the kids love it for Netflix!\n",
      "The picture is best in a dark room, but even with a little light coming in the image is viewable.\n",
      "Picture quality is excellent.\n",
      "Sound quality is awesome for the size of the thing.I'm projecting straight onto a bedroom wall and it looks amazing.I am a very picky buyer , and I'm satisfied.\n",
      "Youd have to spend 4 to 4k to get better quality.Netflix is no longer native , don't really care , plugged my firestick right in and back to life as usual.\n",
      "Great, that the projector can be so clear, I can do without the TV at home.\n",
      "Nice projector, I originally wanted to put it in the bedroom, but found that there are batteries for use in the garden, have to buy a curtain, looking forwsrd to it.\n",
      "Hubby bought a projector off of Ebay and it would shut off.\n",
      "So he was on the hunt for another one.He found this one and is so incredibly pleased!\n",
      "Small but mighty!\n",
      "Great picture.\n",
      "So happy!\n",
      "Now we have have our outside movie nights when it cools down!\n",
      "Great picture.\n",
      "Very user friendly.\n",
      "Feel like we have a movie theater in our backyard.\n",
      "I have been looking for a portable home projector for some time.\n",
      "I have used Epson projector and picture quality is just as good.\n",
      "I'm simply amazed.\n",
      "Excellent product!\n",
      "Very happy\n",
      "Gran producto ideal para ver series y peliculas en familia pr√°cticamente un cine en casa\n",
      "I got this for my new apartment.\n",
      "Hard year for everyone.\n",
      "And specially for a new college student.\n",
      "All my roommates LOVE this portable projector.\n",
